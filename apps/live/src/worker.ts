// Defense-in-depth response headers. None of these block existing
// functionality; they shut down whole classes of attack surface that
// the editor doesn't need to expose:
//   - X-Frame-Options DENY: stop the editor being framed inside a
//     malicious site (clickjacking).
//   - X-Content-Type-Options nosniff: stop the browser sniffing a
//     mistyped response into an executable type.
//   - Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin: URLs carry
//     diagram ids in the path; don't leak full paths to third-party
//     sites the user might click out to.
//   - Permissions-Policy: deny every powerful feature the editor
//     doesn't use (camera / mic / geolocation / payment / USB) so a
//     compromised script can't request them. Clipboard isn't denied
//     because the image picker uses paste; fullscreen=self is
//     allowed for the laser-presenter view.
//   - Strict-Transport-Security: 1-year HSTS with includeSubDomains.
//     Pins the browser to HTTPS for the apex + every subdomain
//     after the first visit; subsequent loads can't be downgraded
//     to plain HTTP by a network-level attacker. Cloudflare's zone-
//     level toggle covers the same ground but this code-side header
//     is the source of truth so self-host deployments inherit it.
//
// CSP itself is left for a dedicated cycle: it needs explicit allow-
// listing for Clerk's external script + the api / R2 origins, and
// getting that wrong silently breaks auth.
