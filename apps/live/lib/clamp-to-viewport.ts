// Floating-popover viewport clamp. Three editor popovers (TabBar's
// per-tab menu, PortalMenu, TabLinkPicker) all need to nudge their
// portaled box back inside the viewport when the anchor lands too
// close to an edge. Each had its own copy of the same math, and all
// three carried the same self-referential bug: a clamp computed
// against the box's current rect can never relax once applied,
// because the box has already been translated into-frame and the
// next measurement reports "no overflow" forever.
//
// One helper, two changes from the original copies:
//
// - The natural (pre-translate) edges are derived by subtracting
//   the caller's previous adjust from the live rect. Overflow is
//   checked against those, so a clamp that's no longer needed
//   shrinks back to zero on the next re-measure.
// - Returns the new adjust unconditionally; the caller compares
//   against its previous state to avoid setState-loops.

// re-exported under the historical name so existing importers are unchanged.
