// Single source of truth for "is Clerk enabled on this deployment".
//
// Self-hosters (per spec/03 + spec/04) can ship livediagram without
// provisioning a Clerk app at all — the canvas runs in pure guest
// mode using the X-Owner-Id header (which is also how a deployed-
// with-Clerk install handles signed-out visitors). This flag flips
// every Clerk-aware module into either real-Clerk-context or
// pure-guest pass-through at module load time.
//
// `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars are baked into the static export at build
// time, so the flag is effectively a compile-time constant — no
// per-render cost, no React state, and the bundle can drop the Clerk
// pages' content entirely on a no-key build via dead-code elimination
// once tree-shaking gets aggressive.
