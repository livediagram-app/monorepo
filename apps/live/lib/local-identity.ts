// Single source of truth for the browser-local identity state that
// guests rely on (spec/04). The key strings used to be inlined at
// every read/write site across editor-page, the new-diagram page and
// the Clerk bootstrap hook — renaming the namespace or evolving the
// schema needed a grep + sweep across several files. Centralising
// them here means a v3 migration is a one-line edit and the intent
// of each piece of state is documented once.
//
// All accessors are SSR-safe (via the shared local-storage-safe
// helpers, which guard `typeof window` + swallow private-mode throws)
// so they can be called from module bodies or non-effect code paths
// without crashing the static export build.
//
// Namespace prefix: `livediagram:v2:`. The `v2` tag survives a
// future schema break — if the shape of a stored value changes
// incompatibly we'll bump to `v3:` and drop the old keys at read
// time so a returning guest doesn't end up with mixed-version state.
