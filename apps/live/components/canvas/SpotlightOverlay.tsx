// Spotlight presenter overlay (spec/09). A full-bleed, pointer-transparent
// shroud over the canvas with a single soft circle of clarity around the
// cursor. The shroud + the hole are one radial-gradient: transparent at the
// centre, ramping to a dark fill at the light's radius and holding that fill
// across the rest of the canvas. The gradient centre tracks the cursor in
// screen space (so the light does NOT pan / zoom with the diagram), and the
// feathered rim gives the "emits light" falloff a hard-edged mask can't.
//
// The glowing dot at the centre is drawn here as a DOM element (the OS cursor
// is hidden via .cursor-spotlight): a data-URI SVG cursor renders
// inconsistently across browsers and silently falls back, whereas this locks
// to the light's exact centre and can actually glow.
//
// pointer-events-none so clicks fall through to <main>, where the Canvas
// capture handlers turn left-click into grow and right-click into shrink.

// Shroud colour (slate-950 at 82%) — dark enough to mute the diagram, not so
// opaque that a faint sense of the surrounding shapes is lost.
const SHROUD = 'rgba(2, 6, 23, 0.82)';

// distance just inside the radius, so the light fades out rather than
// stopping at a crisp line.
