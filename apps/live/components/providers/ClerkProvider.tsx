// pattern in apps/dashboard/components/providers/ClerkProvider.tsx).
// The provider's runtime behaviour is identical; only the surrounding
// SSR plumbing differs. Hook consumers (`useAuth`, `useSignIn`, etc.)
// keep importing from `@clerk/nextjs` because those don't trigger
// the Server Actions check.

// `useSignIn` / `useSignUp` work anywhere in the tree. Mirrors
// Manager Toolkit's dashboard/components/providers/ClerkProvider —
// same shape, livediagram routes.
//
// When `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` isn't set (self-host
// without Clerk, per spec/03 + spec/04), the provider becomes a
// no-op pass-through — children render directly. Every Clerk-aware
// module reads the same `clerkEnabled` flag and short-circuits to a
// guest-only path; the api worker independently degrades to guest
// when `CLERK_JWKS_URL` is unset, so the two sides stay in sync.
//
// Hybrid mode (spec/04): even with Clerk enabled, nothing here gates
// the editor — the canvas keeps working as a guest. Auth is purely
// additive: when signed in, the editor sends a Bearer token instead
// of `X-Owner-Id` (wired in `useClerkApiBootstrap`).
