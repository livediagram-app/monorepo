A tab is { name, elements: Element[] }. Every element needs a unique string "id".
A diagram has one or more tabs, each its own canvas. create_diagram makes a
diagram with one or more tabs at once; add_tab appends another tab to an existing
diagram (e.g. an overview tab, then a detail tab zooming into one subsystem).

## Element types
${types}

Boxed elements (shape, text, sticky, table, image, annotation) carry:
  id, type, x, y, width, height, and an optional "label" (string).
  - "shape" is the element for a NODE — a labelled box, the default building
    block of almost every diagram. It also needs "shape": one of
    ${shapeKinds}. The default box / process step is "square" (a rounded
    rectangle that fills its width × height) — there is NO "rectangle" kind.
    Use "diamond" for a decision, "cylinder" for a datastore, "stadium" for a
    start/end, "circle", "hexagon", "parallelogram" for I/O, and "frame" for a
    section container. An unknown kind is coerced to "square".
  - "text" is BARE text with no box, fill, or border. Use it ONLY for a
    free-standing title, caption, legend, or note — NEVER for a node. A node
    that has a label is a "shape" with a "label" (use shape: "square"), not a
    "text". Defaulting to "text" for nodes makes a diagram of floating words
    with no boxes; reach for "shape" unless you specifically want loose text.

## Arrows
type "arrow" with "from" and "to" endpoints. PREFER pinned endpoints so arrows
track their shapes when laid out or moved:
  from / to: { "kind": "pinned", "elementId": "<id>", "anchor": "<a>" }
  anchors: ${anchors}
A free endpoint is { "kind": "free", "x": number, "y": number }. Arrows may carry
an optional "label".

## Layout — your call
YOU decide the layout; the server does not override a real arrangement.
- For a deliberate shape, set explicit x/y and they are kept as given: a life
  CYCLE as a ring with an arrow looping back to the start, a hierarchy as a
  top-down tree, a comparison as a grid, a timeline as a row.
- For a simple flow you'd rather not position, leave coordinates rough or zero
  and the server arranges a clean graph (>= 3 nodes joined by pinned arrows).
- The "layout" tool argument forces it either way: "preserve" keeps your
  coordinates, "auto" re-lays-out the graph. Omitted = auto-detect (a real
  arrangement is kept; nodes left piled at one point get laid out).
- Supporting text (a per-node description, a caption, a title) is ALWAYS kept
  where you place it and never auto-arranged — so put it next to the node it
  describes, not in a loose pile.

## Themes (the look)
Set "theme" on create_diagram / add_tab to one of these presets and the server
paints the whole diagram + canvas with it (you still omit per-element colours):
  ${themeIds}
Defaults to "brand" (clean, light). Rough guide: cool blues = ocean / sky;
greens = forest / pine / olive; warm = sunset / sand / rose / mocha; neutral =
mono / steel / cream; dark backdrops = midnight / charcoal / plum / abyss;
multi-colour (each branch a different hue) = rainbow / pastel / tropical /
autumn / jewel; uml = standard UML notation colours. Pick one that fits the
subject; one theme applies to all tabs in a create_diagram call.

## Design rules (diagrams that read well)
- Nodes are SHAPES, not text. Use type "shape" (shape: "square" by default,
  "diamond" for a decision, "cylinder" for a datastore) for every box in the
  diagram. Reserve type "text" for stand-alone titles / captions.
- Do NOT set colours. The theme owns fill / stroke / text colour; omit them and
  the diagram inherits a coherent palette.
- Size sibling nodes consistently (e.g. every box 160x64).
- Prefer pinned arrows (node -> node) so they track their shapes when moved.
- Give every node an id and a short, clear label.

export const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `Tools to find, view, create, add tabs to, and edit the user's livediagram diagrams.
The calling model produces the diagram elements AND decides their layout; this
server validates, persists, and renders them, and only auto-arranges the graph
when you ask it to (or leave nodes unplaced). The full element format is
described inline on each tool's element argument, so you already have everything
you need from the tool definitions: do NOT web-search, open the open-source repo,
or read another diagram to learn the schema. In short: use a unique "id" per
element, make nodes "shape" elements (a labelled box) NOT "text" (text is only
for titles/captions), position elements yourself for a deliberate shape (a cycle
as a ring, a tree, a grid), prefer pinned arrows (node -> node), and do NOT set
colours, the theme owns them.`;
