A tab is { name, elements: Element[] }. Every element needs a unique string "id".
A diagram has one or more tabs, each its own canvas. create_diagram makes a
diagram with one or more tabs at once; add_tab appends another tab to an existing
diagram (e.g. an overview tab, then a detail tab zooming into one subsystem).

## Element types
${types}

Boxed elements (shape, text, sticky, table, image, annotation) carry:
  id, type, x, y, width, height, and an optional "label" (string).
  - "shape" also needs "shape": square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, diamond,
    triangle, cylinder, cloud, hexagon, parallelogram, star, and more, plus
    "frame" (a section container drawn behind its contents). Unknown shape kinds
    fall back to a rounded box rather than being dropped.
  - "text" is a label-only element (no fill / border).

## Arrows
type "arrow" with "from" and "to" endpoints. PREFER pinned endpoints so arrows
track their shapes when laid out or moved:
  from / to: { "kind": "pinned", "elementId": "<id>", "anchor": "<a>" }
  anchors: ${anchors}
A free endpoint is { "kind": "free", "x": number, "y": number }. Arrows may carry
an optional "label".

## Layout — your call
YOU decide the layout; the server does not override a real arrangement.
- For a deliberate shape, set explicit x/y and they are kept as given: a life
  CYCLE as a ring with an arrow looping back to the start, a hierarchy as a
  top-down tree, a comparison as a grid, a timeline as a row.
- For a simple flow you'd rather not position, leave coordinates rough or zero
  and the server arranges a clean graph (>= 3 nodes joined by pinned arrows).
- The "layout" tool argument forces it either way: "preserve" keeps your
  coordinates, "auto" re-lays-out the graph. Omitted = auto-detect (a real
  arrangement is kept; nodes left piled at one point get laid out).
- Supporting text (a per-node description, a caption, a title) is ALWAYS kept
  where you place it and never auto-arranged — so put it next to the node it
  describes, not in a loose pile.

## Design rules (diagrams that read well)
- Do NOT set colours. The theme owns fill / stroke / text colour; omit them and
  the diagram inherits a coherent palette.
- Size sibling nodes consistently (e.g. every box 160x64).
- Prefer pinned arrows (node -> node) so they track their shapes when moved.
- Give every node an id and a short, clear label.
