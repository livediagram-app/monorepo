// Privacy section — mirrors the dark visual treatment of the
// UseCaseCarousel above so the landing page reads as two distinct
// promises (what you can make, how we handle the data) separated by
// a darker band. Each card now leads with a dark-friendly animated
// illustration in the same vocabulary as FeatureArt (Frame + SVG +
// fa-* keyframes), so the section reads as design-of-a-piece rather
// than glyph-and-text.
