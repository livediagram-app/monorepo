-- Drop change_log.participant_name + participant_color (item #15 /
-- spec/17). They were copy-on-write snapshots so the UI could render
-- "who did this" without needing the participants row to still
-- exist, but the denormalisation costs us:
--
-- 1. A rename in `participants` doesn't propagate to historical
--    change_log entries — old rows show the participant's old name
--    forever.
-- 2. Two columns of duplicate state on every audit row, the most
--    write-heavy table by entry count.
--
-- Post-migration the api joins through `participants` on read.
-- Orphaned participant ids (sign-out, account delete cascading
-- through diagrams → tabs → change_log doesn't always reach a still
-- alive participants row) fall back to "Unknown" / a muted grey on
-- the client.
--
-- Standard 12-step recreate dance again — `tab_id REFERENCES
-- tabs(id)` would let DROP COLUMN succeed in isolation, but doing
-- two recreates back-to-back is cleaner than mixing semantics.
