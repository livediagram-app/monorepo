-- User-built custom themes, per spec/44.
--
-- Owner-scoped (Clerk sub or the X-Owner-Id guest id, like folders /
-- diagrams), guests included. `definition` is the JSON-serialised
-- themable payload (CustomThemeDefinition): backdrop + element colours
-- + optional palette / per-shape colours. The id is `custom:<uuid>`,
-- minted client-side, so it never collides with a built-in theme id and
-- can sit on Tab.theme unchanged. The (owner_id, created_at) index
-- serves the newest-first list endpoint.
