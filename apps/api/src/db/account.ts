// participant id moves to their Clerk userId so the new account sees
// the diagrams, folders, shared-with-them list, editor preferences,
// AND uploaded images they built as a guest.
//
// shared_with's primary key is (owner_id, diagram_id), so a naive
// UPDATE could PK-collide if the visitor accepted the same share
// link both as a guest AND, later in the same session, as Clerk
// (recordSharedAccess upserts a row each time). INSERT OR IGNORE
// then DELETE handles both cases in one shot: copy guest rows to
// the Clerk userId, skip rows where (clerkId, diagramId) already
// exists, then drop every leftover guest row. The skipped Clerk
// rows keep the role + last_seen they already had (which is the
// more recent of the two paths the user actually used).
//
// images has a UNIQUE (owner_id, sha256) index that drives the
// dedupe. UPDATE OR IGNORE skips rows whose sha256 already exists
// on the Clerk side (the user uploaded the same bytes under both
// identities). The skipped guest row stays at fromOwnerId; the
// formerly-guest diagrams (now Clerk-owned) still resolve those
// image ids via the diagram-reference fallback in GET
// /api/images/:id (spec/19), so the canvas keeps rendering them.
// Only the gallery list filters by owner_id, so the dedupe loser
// stops showing up there, which is the right outcome (the Clerk
// twin is identical bytes anyway).
//
// Other tables (`change_log`, `share_links`, `tabs`) don't carry
// their own owner_id, they link via `diagram_id` which is
// owner-bound, so updating the diagrams cascade-fixes them
// implicitly.
