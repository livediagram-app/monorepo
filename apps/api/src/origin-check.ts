// Localhost-pair detection for the telemetry endpoint's same-origin
// filter (spec/22). The ingest endpoint rejects requests whose Origin
// header is present and isn't the api worker's own origin so casual
// drive-by cross-site posters can't inflate the public usage chart,
// but local dev legitimately serves two different ports (the live
// editor on :3002 / the telemetry dashboard on :3003 posting to the
// api worker on :8787), and those should be allowed through. This
// helper widens the filter to treat any localhost-to-localhost pair
// as same-origin enough for dev. Production never sees a localhost
// origin, so the widening is dev-only in practice.
//
// Lives in its own module so the rule has a test surface separate
// from the route handler: matches the precedent set by image-strip,
// image-sniff, tab-row, folder-row, share-link-row, change-log-row.

// IPv4 + IPv6 + textual loopback hostnames the browser may emit.

// including the brackets, so the literal stays bracketed here.

// either being a non-loopback hostname, or either being empty.
