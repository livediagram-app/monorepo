// rest of the D1 module along (same pattern as tab-row.ts,
// change-log-row.ts, share-link-row.ts, image-strip.ts, image-sniff.ts).
//
// The two fields that matter most for safety are `owner_id` (every
// folder endpoint gates on it) and `parent_id` (drives the
// Explorer's nested tree and the cycle-prevention walk in
// createFolder / updateFolder). If either drifts, ownership
// boundaries leak or the explorer renders a malformed tree.
