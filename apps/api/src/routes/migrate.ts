// Moves every `owner_id` row (diagrams, folders, prefs, images, shared
// list) from a source owner to a target owner. Two flows:
//
//  1. Sign-up (guest → Clerk): the live app calls this once Clerk reports
//     a session, to bind the caller's guest data to their account. The
//     SOURCE guest id must prove possession via its HMAC signature
//     (`guestSignature`) when signing is configured — otherwise anyone who
//     merely observed a guest's id (it leaks via DTOs / presence) could
//     claim that guest's entire data set. See auth/owner-signature.ts.
//
//  2. Legacy upgrade (unsigned guest → freshly-minted signed guest): an
//     existing guest created before signing shipped has an unsigned id and
//     so can't satisfy flow 1. The live app mints a signed id (POST
//     /api/guest-id) and calls this with no Clerk token to move the old
//     data onto the new id. The SOURCE here is the caller's current
//     `X-Owner-Id` (the same bearer credential every guest request uses);
//     the TARGET is the new signed id, proven by `toSignature`. NOTE: the
//     source is only bearer-authenticated, so this path carries the same
//     residual exposure as the pre-signing guest model for legacy ids
//     during the transition window (spec/04). New guests never use it.
//
// Idempotent: a no-op (source == target) moves zero rows.
