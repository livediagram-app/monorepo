// POST /api/guest-id — mint a signed guest owner-id.
//
// The SERVER generates the id (a fresh UUID) and returns it together with
// its HMAC signature. Because the id is server-chosen, a caller can only
// ever obtain a signature for an id we handed to them — never for an id
// they observed in someone else's diagram DTO or presence frame. The live
// app caches both and replays the signature in the /api/migrate body so
// the worker can prove the caller actually owns the guest data it's
// claiming (see auth/owner-signature.ts + spec/04).
//
// When GUEST_ID_HMAC_SECRET is unset (self-host that hasn't configured
// it), the endpoint still mints an id but with a null signature, and
// /api/migrate keeps its legacy unsigned behaviour.
