// Account self-deletion. Clerk-only — no X-Owner-Id fallback,
// because the entire purpose is to wipe data bound to a
// verified Clerk identity. The client then calls Clerk's
// `user.delete()` to drop the Clerk record too; the order
// (backend first, then Clerk) means a Clerk-delete failure
// leaves the user signed in but with empty data, which they
// can recover from by re-signing-out — vs. losing access to
// Clerk but leaving orphaned rows in D1. Idempotent: re-
// calling with the same Clerk id is a no-op once the rows
// are gone.
