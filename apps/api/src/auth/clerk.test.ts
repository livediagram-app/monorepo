// `getClerkUserId` is the spec/04 hybrid identity gate on the api
// worker side: when it returns null, the caller falls through to the
// legacy `X-Owner-Id` header so the guest path keeps serving. The
// "valid token" branch hits a remote JWKS via `jose` and lives in
// integration territory, but every "fall through to guest" branch
// here is a critical, easy-to-pin early exit. A regression in any of
// these would either lock guests out (if a stricter branch started
// throwing) or quietly accept malformed Bearer headers (if the parser
// drifted away from the "Bearer " prefix), and the guest path is the
// editor's promise to never require auth (spec/03 + spec/04).
