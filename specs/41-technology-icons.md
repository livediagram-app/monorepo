# 41 — Technology icons

A **Technology** category in the command palette: full-colour brand icons for the
infrastructure services people put on system-architecture diagrams (AWS S3,
Lambda, EC2, Azure Functions, Kubernetes, Postgres, ...). They sit beside the
existing **Icons** category but are deliberately a separate surface, because
they are coloured filled marks rather than the single-weight, stroke-tinted line
art the Icons catalogue holds. Mixing them would break the consistent line-art
look of that catalogue.

## Why a separate category, not more entries in Icons

The Icons catalogue (`apps/live/lib/icons.ts`, spec/09) is Feather/Lucide-style:
each glyph is a set of stroke primitives in a 0..24 box, drawn `fill="none"` and
**tinted by the element's stroke colour** so it themes like a line drawing.
Brand service icons are the opposite: fixed multi-colour fills that must NOT be
recoloured (an orange Lambda is only recognisable orange). They need their own
model (raw coloured SVG markup, not stroke prims) and their own render path
(no stroke tint), so they live in their own catalogue and palette tab.

## The element — reuses the `icon` shape kind

A Technology icon is the **same `shape: 'icon'` element** the Icons category
produces — no new element type, no schema migration. `element.iconId` keys the
icon; the only difference is the id resolves in the **tech-icon registry**
instead of the line-art catalogue. The shared `createShape('icon', …)` already
gives icons the two properties this feature needs:

- `aspectLocked: true` — the brand mark never warps on resize.
- `textAlignY: 'bottom'` — the label sits in a band **below** the glyph, the
  architecture-diagram convention (icon on top, caption beneath). This is why
  double-clicking a Technology icon to type drops the text under it, which is
  exactly the desired behaviour for labelling `S3`, `Orders DB`, etc.

`getIcon` (line-art) falls back to a placeholder for an unknown id, so the
render path **dispatches on the id**: `isTechIconId(iconId)` picks the coloured
brand renderer, otherwise the stroke-tinted line renderer.

## The catalogue — `apps/live/lib/tech-icons.ts`

```ts
type TechIconDef = {
  id: string; // e.g. 'aws-s3', 'azure-functions', 'k8s'
  label: string; // 'S3', 'Azure Functions', 'Kubernetes'
  short?: string; // short palette caption where `label` would truncate ('VM')
  provider: TechProvider; // 'aws' | 'azure' | 'generic'
  keywords: string; // extra search terms
  color: string; // tile fill — the service / brand colour
  glyph: string; // inner SVG markup (0..24 box) drawn white on the tile
};
```

- `iconId` stays a plain string in the data model (as today), so adding an icon
  is a one-file change with no migration. An id present in neither catalogue
  renders the existing placeholder.
- The mark is a **brand-coloured rounded tile + a white line-art glyph** — the
  AWS resource-icon visual language, applied uniformly across AWS / Azure /
  generic for a cohesive palette, using each service's **official brand /
  category colour**. It is authored in-repo as compact SVG, not the verbatim
  vendor asset packs — keeps the bundle small, renders crisply at icon size, and
  sidesteps redistributing proprietary SVGs from a public MIT repo (see spec/03,
  spec/06). Swapping in a vendor's official SVG later is a per-id edit.

### v1 coverage (curated common set, ~38)

- **AWS:** S3, EC2, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFront, Route 53,
  VPC, SQS, SNS, ECS, EKS, CloudWatch, IAM.
- **Azure:** Virtual Machines, Blob Storage, App Service, Functions, SQL
  Database, Cosmos DB, AKS, Virtual Network, Load Balancer, Service Bus, Key
  Vault, Monitor.
- **Generic infra:** Kubernetes, Docker, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB,
  Kafka, Nginx, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, GraphQL.

The set is intentionally the services people reach for first; it expands by
adding `TechIconDef` entries.

## Palette — the Technology tab

A new tab in `PaletteTabBar` (`CommandPalette.tsx`), alongside Shapes / Tools /
Devices / Icons. It mirrors the Icons tab: a search box plus a **provider**
filter dropdown (All / AWS / Azure / Generic). Clicking a tile adds the icon at
the viewport centre; dragging a tile onto the canvas drops it at the pointer.

Unlike the line-art Icons grid (5 across, no captions — a labelled line icon's
shape reads on its own), the Technology grid is **4 across with a caption under
each tile**: the brand glyphs aren't self-explanatory at thumbnail size, so the
name sits beneath each one. A handful of long names carry a `short` caption
(`Virtual Machine` → `VM`, `Virtual Network` → `VNet`, `Load Balancer` →
`Load Bal.`, `Blob Storage` → `Blob`, `SQL Database` → `SQL DB`, `Elasticsearch`
→ `Elastic`) so they don't truncate to an ambiguous prefix; the full `label` is
still used for search, the aria-label, and the on-canvas element.

Unlike the Icons tab, a Technology tile is **always a standalone element** — it
never drops _inside_ a selected shape as an inline icon (a coloured brand tile
beside a shape's text is not meaningful, and the inline-icon renderer only knows
line-art prims). It therefore carries its own DnD MIME (`TECH_ICON_DND_MIME`),
which the canvas drop handler routes to a standalone-icon create and which the
shape drop target ignores. The same rule holds _after_ placement: dragging an
existing standalone tech icon over a shape leaves it standalone — the
icon-fold-into-shape gesture (`useEditorDrag`, which absorbs a dragged line-art
`icon` shape into the shape beneath it) excludes tech icons via `isTechIconId`.

## Rendering — `apps/live/components/tech-icon-glyph.tsx`

`TechIconGlyph` paints the brand-coloured tile + the icon's white `glyph` markup
inside an `<svg>` whose viewBox expands from `0 0 24 24` to `0 0 24 40` when the
element has a label (glyph pinned to the top 60%, label band beneath) — the same
label-room trick `IconGlyph` uses, so the coloured and line-art icons place
captions identically. No stroke tint is applied; the brand colour is the tile
fill and the glyph is white.

## Telemetry

Adding a Technology icon fires `track('Element', 'Added', 'TechIcon')` — a
distinct `type` from line-art icons (`'Icon'`) so the dashboard can tell
architecture-icon usage apart, while reusing the closed `Element` / `Added`
category/action pair (spec/22). The `type` is the constant `'TechIcon'`, never
the specific service id, keeping telemetry free of content.

## Out of scope (v1)

- GCP (the provider model already allows adding it later).
- Recolouring brand icons (they keep their fixed brand colours).
- Verbatim vendor asset packs / a downloadable icon-pack importer.
