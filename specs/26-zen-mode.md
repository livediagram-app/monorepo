# Zen mode

A distraction-free **focus mode** for the editor: hide every piece of
floating chrome so only the canvas content remains, for reading, sharing
a screen, or thinking without the toolbars in the way.

## What it does

When zen mode is on, the editor hides:

- the editor header (top bar),
- the tab bar,
- the command palette (tools + add-element), the context / inspector
  panel, the Explorer, the Activity panel, the comments panel, the AI
  panel, the mobile dock, and the owner / role status badge,
- the empty-canvas prompt and the undo/redo history dock.

What stays:

- the **canvas and its content** (elements, alignment guides, laser
  trails, remote cursors, selection — interaction is unaffected),
- the **zoom controls** (bottom-right), so the user can still zoom / fit,
- the **zen toggle on the zoom controls**, which flips to an exit-zen
  control in zen mode so there's always a visible way out.

Zen mode is purely a view state. It changes nothing about the diagram,
never persists to the server, and is not synced to other participants —
each viewer focuses independently. It is available to everyone, including
view-only visitors (focusing is read-only).

## How it's toggled

- **Enter + exit share one home — the zoom controls** (bottom-right),
  which stay visible in zen mode. Outside zen the button shows a
  fullscreen / expand icon ("Zen mode"); inside zen it shows a compress
  icon ("Exit zen mode"). Keeping entry and exit in the same place means
  the user looks to one spot for the mode toggle, and it keeps the
  command-palette tool row (Pan / Select / Laser) to the three actual
  canvas tools rather than overflowing a fourth button.
- **Keyboard:** `Z` toggles it on and off; `Escape` exits when active.
  The binding obeys the per-device keyboard-shortcuts toggle and the
  usual text-input / label-edit bailouts (so typing a `z` into a label
  never flips the mode). Listed in the shortcuts dialog under Tools.

## Telemetry

Flipping zen mode emits `UI / Toggled / ZenModeOn` and
`UI / Toggled / ZenModeOff` (spec/22), the same shape as the dark-mode
and minimal-panel toggles.

## Implementation notes

- State lives in `usePanelLayout` (`zenMode` / `setZenMode`) — it's pure
  UI chrome state with no diagram coupling, alongside the other panel
  visibility flags. `useEditorState` wraps it in `toggleZenMode` (adds
  the telemetry) and exposes that to the keyboard hook, the palette enter
  button, and the zoom-dock exit button.
- The chrome is hidden by the same gates that already hide it during the
  welcome flow — each `welcomeOpen ? null` / `welcomeOpen || readOnly`
  guard in `CanvasChrome` also checks `zenMode`. The header + tab bar are
  hidden in `EditorView`.
- Not a `CanvasTool` (Pan / Select / Laser are mutually-exclusive cursor
  modes); zen mode is an orthogonal visibility flag, so it sits beside
  the tool row rather than inside the tool group.
