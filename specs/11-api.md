# API app

The HTTP + WebSocket layer the live editor calls for diagram persistence and realtime collab.

- **Workspace:** `apps/api` (`@livediagram/api`).
- **Worker name:** `livediagram-api`.
- **Mount:** routed from the [router worker](08-router-app.md) at `/api/*`. The router forwards the request as-is — the api worker sees the full `/api/...` path.

## Why this exists

The first prototype phase ([spec 02](02-prototype-scope.md)) ran entirely client-side with `localStorage` persistence. Once realtime collaboration entered scope, server state became necessary: a Durable Object holds the in-room participant list and broadcasts ops between connected clients, and D1 owns the durable diagram snapshot. The live app no longer reads or writes `localStorage` for diagrams — `apps/live/lib/api-client.ts` is the single boundary.

## Tech

- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers.
- **DB:** Cloudflare D1 (binding `DB`). Schema lives in `apps/api/migrations/`; each numbered file is one applied change. Treat the migration log as the source of truth on the schema — features get a migration each, so the count grows.
- **Realtime:** Cloudflare Durable Objects (`DiagramRoom`, binding `DIAGRAM_ROOM`). One instance per diagram id, identified by the diagram's UUID via `idFromName`.

## Wire-format types

The DTO shapes the api worker emits + the live editor consumes live in `packages/api-schema` (`@livediagram/api-schema`) — `Diagram`, `TabSummary`, `TabRecord`, `Folder`, `ShareLink`, `ChangeLogEntry`, `ServerMessage` / `ClientMessage`, and the room op vocabulary (`RoomOp` / `RoomOutgoing` / `RoomIncoming`). Both apps import them; the api worker also re-exports under historical `XxxDTO` aliases (`apps/api/src/types.ts`) for backward compatibility with its existing call sites.

Defining the wire shapes once means server and client cannot drift — adding a field on one side without updating the other is a typechecker error. **Do not redefine these types inline in `apps/api/` or `apps/live/`**; extend the schema package instead. Per CLAUDE.md the reuse-over-duplication rule is non-negotiable.

## Auth

The api accepts two equivalent ways of identifying the request owner, in this order of preference (see [spec/04](04-auth-and-guest-access.md)):

1. **Clerk Bearer JWT** — `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Verified against `env.CLERK_JWKS_URL` in `apps/api/src/auth/clerk.ts` using `jose`'s `createRemoteJWKSet` + `jwtVerify`. The token's `sub` claim is the owner id. Returns null on any failure (invalid signature, expired, malformed, missing env var) — never 401, because the worker must still serve the guest path.
2. **Legacy guest header** — `X-Owner-Id: <participant-id>`. The participant id is a `crypto.randomUUID()` minted on first visit and persisted in `localStorage` under `livediagram:v2:self-id`. Used when the Bearer header is absent or verification failed.

The request handler computes the resolution once at the top of `fetch`:

```ts
const clerkUserId = await getClerkUserId(env, request);
const resolveOwner = () => clerkUserId ?? request.headers.get('X-Owner-Id');
```

Every endpoint uses `resolveOwner()` instead of reading the header directly, so adding new endpoints inherits the hybrid behaviour automatically.

`CLERK_JWKS_URL` lives in `wrangler.toml` `[vars]` (not `secret`, since the JWKS is public). Leaving it as an empty string puts the api in pure-guest mode — useful for local dev or for environments where Clerk hasn't been provisioned yet.

Visitor-edit endpoints (`PUT /api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId`, the change-log writes) still also accept `X-Share-Code` for share-link auth — that header is checked via `canEditDiagram()` and is orthogonal to the Clerk-vs-guest choice. A visitor following a share link is a guest who provides a code, regardless of whether they're separately signed in.

## Endpoints

All JSON. CORS allows any origin (the live app is same-origin via the router; this is mostly a dev convenience). Routes are dispatched in `apps/api/src/index.ts` — that file is short enough to skim for the authoritative list.

Owner-only routes require `X-Owner-Id`; shared-edit routes accept `X-Owner-Id` + `X-Share-Code` from visitors holding an edit-role share link.

Cascades via `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `tabs`, `share_links`, `change_log`. Returns `{ deleted: { diagrams, folders } }`. Client follows up with Clerk's `user.delete()` to drop the Clerk account itself. |

## Realtime model

The `DiagramRoom` Durable Object holds the live state for one diagram id. Clients connect via the `/ws` endpoint and immediately send a `hello` identifying themselves; the room broadcasts a `presence` snapshot whenever the set changes.

Edits propagate via opaque `op` messages. The room never inspects or persists them — it just rebroadcasts to peers. The op vocabulary (defined in `apps/live/lib/api-client.ts` as `RoomOp`):

| Kind           | Carries                                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Conflict resolution is **last-writer-wins** on `tab` and `diagram-meta` ops. When a client receives one it replaces its local copy and skips the next debounced save (a ref flag prevents the obvious echo loop). Per-tab granularity (vs the original full-diagram `tabs` op) means concurrent edits to _different_ tabs no longer clobber each other — see [13-per-tab-storage.md](13-per-tab-storage.md).

This is still intentionally crude — operational-transform / CRDT remains out of scope. Two clients editing the same tab simultaneously clobber on the slower writer.

The room never touches D1; persistence is the REST `PUT /api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId` call, fired from the live app's debounced save effect.

## Data model

The schema starts at `0001_init.sql` and evolves migration-by-migration; the migration files double as commit history of the shape. Today, in broad strokes:

- **`diagrams`** — id, owner, name, share flag, folder fk, timestamps. The original `data` JSON column was dropped in migration 0006 once tabs moved to their own rows.
- **`tabs`** — one row per tab keyed on `(id)`, FK to `diagrams(id)` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. The body lives in a `data` JSON blob (elements + per-tab settings — theme, background, lock). Order is tracked by `order_index`. See [13-per-tab-storage.md](13-per-tab-storage.md) for why.
- **`participants`** — id, name, color. Volatile presence/status state stays on the wire.
- **`share_links`** — code → diagramId + role. Multiple links per diagram are supported; revoking a link is a row delete.
- **`change_log`** — per-diagram audit entries that drive the Activity Panel + Revert path. See [12-activity-and-audit.md](12-activity-and-audit.md).
- **`folders`** — id, owner, name, optional self-referential `parent_id`. Diagrams reference a folder via `diagrams.folder_id`. Both FKs `ON DELETE SET NULL` so deleting a folder promotes its children. Cycle prevention is enforced in the API layer (D1 can't declaratively).

Document-store hybrid: meta + folder + share state lives in real columns; element content lives in tab `data` JSON. Element-level SQL filtering isn't a use case today, so normalising element rows would buy nothing — and the editor already round-trips JSON for every save.

## One-time setup

Before the first deploy:

1. `pnpm --filter @livediagram/api exec wrangler d1 create livediagram`
2. Copy the printed `database_id` into `apps/api/wrangler.toml` (replacing `TODO_RUN_WRANGLER_D1_CREATE`).
3. `pnpm --filter @livediagram/api run db:migrate:remote` to apply migrations.

After that, GitHub Actions handles deploys via `deploy.yml` (`deploy-api` step). The router's service binding to `livediagram-api` means the API must deploy before the router.
