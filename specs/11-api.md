# API app

The HTTP + WebSocket layer the live editor calls for diagram persistence and realtime collab.

- **Workspace:** `apps/api` (`@livediagram/api`).
- **Worker name:** `livediagram-api`.
- **Mount:** routed from the [router worker](08-router-app.md) at `/api/*`. The router forwards the request as-is — the api worker sees the full `/api/...` path.

## Why this exists

The first prototype phase ([spec 02](02-prototype-scope.md)) ran entirely client-side with `localStorage` persistence. Once realtime collaboration entered scope, server state became necessary: a Durable Object holds the in-room participant list and broadcasts ops between connected clients, and D1 owns the durable diagram snapshot. The live app no longer reads or writes `localStorage` for diagrams — `apps/live/lib/api-client.ts` is the single boundary.

## Tech

- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers.
- **DB:** Cloudflare D1 (binding `DB`). Schema lives in `apps/api/migrations/`; each numbered file is one applied change. Treat the migration log as the source of truth on the schema — features get a migration each, so the count grows.
- **Realtime:** Cloudflare Durable Objects (`DiagramRoom`, binding `DIAGRAM_ROOM`). One instance per diagram id, identified by the diagram's UUID via `idFromName`.

## Wire-format types

The DTO shapes the api worker emits + the live editor consumes live in `packages/api-schema` (`@livediagram/api-schema`) — `Diagram`, `TabSummary`, `TabRecord`, `Folder`, `ShareLink`, `ChangeLogEntry`, `ServerMessage` / `ClientMessage`, and the room op vocabulary (`RoomOp` / `RoomOutgoing` / `RoomIncoming`). Both apps import them; the api worker also re-exports under historical `XxxDTO` aliases (`apps/api/src/types.ts`) for backward compatibility with its existing call sites.

Defining the wire shapes once means server and client cannot drift — adding a field on one side without updating the other is a typechecker error. **Do not redefine these types inline in `apps/api/` or `apps/live/`**; extend the schema package instead. Per CLAUDE.md the reuse-over-duplication rule is non-negotiable.

## Auth

The api accepts two equivalent ways of identifying the request owner, in this order of preference (see [spec/04](04-auth-and-guest-access.md)):

1. **Clerk Bearer JWT** — `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Verified against `env.CLERK_JWKS_URL` in `apps/api/src/auth/clerk.ts` using `jose`'s `createRemoteJWKSet` + `jwtVerify`. The token's `sub` claim is the owner id. Returns null on any failure (invalid signature, expired, malformed, missing env var) — never 401, because the worker must still serve the guest path.
2. **Legacy guest header** — `X-Owner-Id: <participant-id>`. The participant id is a `crypto.randomUUID()` minted on first visit and persisted in `localStorage` under `livediagram:v2:self-id`. Used when the Bearer header is absent or verification failed.

The request handler computes the resolution once at the top of `fetch`:

```ts
const clerkUserId = await getClerkUserId(env, request);
const resolveOwner = () => clerkUserId ?? request.headers.get('X-Owner-Id');
```

Every endpoint uses `resolveOwner()` instead of reading the header directly, so adding new endpoints inherits the hybrid behaviour automatically.

`CLERK_JWKS_URL` lives in `wrangler.toml` `[vars]` (not `secret`, since the JWKS is public). Leaving it as an empty string puts the api in pure-guest mode — useful for local dev or for environments where Clerk hasn't been provisioned yet.

Visitor-edit endpoints (`PUT /api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId`, the change-log writes) still also accept `X-Share-Code` for share-link auth — that header is checked via `canEditDiagram()` and is orthogonal to the Clerk-vs-guest choice. A visitor following a share link is a guest who provides a code, regardless of whether they're separately signed in.

## Endpoints

All JSON. CORS allows any origin (the live app is same-origin via the router; this is mostly a dev convenience). Routes are dispatched in `apps/api/src/index.ts` — that file is short enough to skim for the authoritative list.

Owner-only routes require a resolved owner — either a verified Clerk Bearer JWT (preferred) or a fallback `X-Owner-Id` header. When neither resolves to a non-null owner, the route returns 400 via the shared `missingAuth()` helper. Shared-edit routes additionally accept `X-Share-Code` from visitors holding an edit-role share link.

| POST   | `/api/diagrams/:id/copy`   | owner / share / shared_with | Body `{ name? }`. Duplicates the source into a new diagram owned by the caller. Skips share_links + change_log + the shareable flag — the copy starts private and audit-free. Authorisation accepts the owner, a valid X-Share-Code for the source, or an existing shared_with row. |

| PUT    | `/api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId`      | owner/share | Replaces the tab's body. Body is the `Tab` shape. The handler rewrites every comment's `authorName` + `authorColor`: comments whose `id` already exists on the stored tab keep their original author fields (so an edit-role visitor can't relabel someone else's existing comment), and brand-new comments get the writer's participant record fields (so the client can't lie about authorship). The `authorName` / `authorColor` values in the request body are ignored.                                        |
| DELETE | `/api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId`      | owner/share | Unlinks the tab from this diagram (drops the `diagram_tabs` row). The underlying `tabs` row survives if any other diagram still references it via `diagram_tabs`. The diagram's `tabIds` order is fixed up via a follow-up PUT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| POST   | `/api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId/link` | owner       | Adds an existing tab to this diagram via a new `diagram_tabs` row. Idempotent (re-linking returns 200 without duplicating). Caller must own this diagram AND own at least one diagram that already contains the tab, so the same auth shape as the legacy duplicate-and-PUT path. Returns `{ tab: TabSummary }`. Used by the TabBar's "Add to another diagram..." menu so subsequent edits on either side write to the same `tabs.data` row and changes propagate (see [spec/17](17-tab-diagram-many-to-many.md)). |

| POST   | `/api/diagrams/:id/share`       | owner | Body `{ role: 'edit' \| 'view' }`. Returns the minted link.   |

| DELETE | `/api/diagrams/:id/log/:entryId`    | owner/share | Drop an entry (Undo / Revert path). |
| DELETE | `/api/diagrams/:id/log?tab=<tabId>` | owner/share | Clear all entries for one tab.      |

**Folders (Explorer organisation — see [15-folders.md](15-folders.md))**

| ------ | ------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/folders`     | owner | List the owner's folders (flat — parentId nests UI). |
| POST   | `/api/folders`     | owner | Body `{ id, name, parentId? }`. Cycle-checked.       |
| PUT    | `/api/folders/:id` | owner | Body `{ name?, parentId? }`. Cycle-checked.          |

| POST   | `/api/migrate` | Clerk only | Body `{ guestOwnerId }`. Reassigns every `diagrams.owner_id` + `folders.owner_id` + `shared_with.owner_id` row from the guest id to the JWT's `sub`. `shared_with` uses INSERT OR IGNORE + DELETE because its PK is `(owner_id, diagram_id)` and the same share may already be accepted under both ids. No `X-Owner-Id` fallback. See [spec/04](04-auth-and-guest-access.md). |

**Shared with you** (migration 0010)

| GET    | `/api/shared`     | owner | Diagrams the resolved owner has previously opened via a share link. Returns `{ id, name, savedAt, role, shareCode }` newest-interaction-first. The `shareCode` is the oldest still-live share link matching the visitor's role — needed so the client can build `/live/diagram/<id>?s=<code>` URLs the non-owner can actually open. Rows whose share has been entirely revoked since the visit are filtered out server-side so the list never surfaces dead links. Drives the Explorer's "Shared with you" accordion. |
| DELETE | `/api/shared/:id` | owner | Drop a single shared_with row — the visitor no longer wants the diagram surfaced in their Shared list. Idempotent; missing rows return 200.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

`GET /api/share/:code` now also UPSERTs a `shared_with` row when the visitor identifies (Bearer or `X-Owner-Id`) AND isn't the diagram's owner. The upsert is silent — share-code resolution succeeds regardless of the bookkeeping write so a transient D1 hiccup doesn't break the visitor's session.

| DELETE | `/api/account` | Clerk only | Wipes every diagrams + folders + images row for the verified Clerk userId, plus the participant record keyed by that id. Before the D1 wipe the handler enumerates the owner's `images` rows and bulk-deletes those keys from the R2 `IMAGES` bucket so account-delete leaves no orphaned image bytes. Cascades via `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `tabs`, `share_links`, `change_log`. Returns `{ deleted: { diagrams, folders, images } }`. Client follows up with Clerk's `user.delete()` to drop the Clerk account itself. |

## Rate limiting

Every state-changing request (`POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE`) on `/api/*` passes through a per-owner cap before any handler runs. The check uses Cloudflare's Workers Rate Limiting API (the `WRITE_RATE_LIMITER` binding declared in `apps/api/wrangler.toml`); the key is the resolved owner id (Clerk userId for signed-in callers, `X-Owner-Id` for guests, the literal `"anonymous"` if neither header is set). Over-limit requests get a `429` with `{ "error": "rate-limited" }`; reads (`GET`, `OPTIONS`) are unmetered.

The ceiling is set to 300 writes per 60 seconds: well above realistic editing traffic (autosave fires once per debounce window, change-log appends are rare, comments are typed by humans) but low enough to stop a bot from spamming diagram / image creation into D1 + R2 quota exhaustion.

Self-host: when the `WRITE_RATE_LIMITER` binding is absent the helper short-circuits to "allow", so deployments without the feature flag still serve. The binding is a Cloudflare paid-tier capability; the open-source path stays unaffected (per [spec/03](03-open-source-and-business-model.md)).

## Realtime model

The `DiagramRoom` Durable Object holds the live state for one diagram id. Clients connect via the `/ws` endpoint and immediately send a `hello` identifying themselves; the room broadcasts a `presence` snapshot whenever the set changes.

Edits propagate via opaque `op` messages. The room never inspects or persists them — it just rebroadcasts to peers. The op vocabulary (defined in `apps/live/lib/api-client.ts` as `RoomOp`):

Conflict resolution is **last-writer-wins** on `tab` and `diagram-meta` ops. When a client receives one it replaces its local copy and skips the next debounced save (a ref flag prevents the obvious echo loop). Per-tab granularity (vs the original full-diagram `tabs` op) means concurrent edits to _different_ tabs no longer clobber each other — see [13-per-tab-storage.md](13-per-tab-storage.md).

This is still intentionally crude — operational-transform / CRDT remains out of scope. Two clients editing the same tab simultaneously clobber on the slower writer.

The room never touches D1; persistence is the REST `PUT /api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId` call, fired from the live app's debounced save effect.

## Data model

The schema starts at `0001_init.sql` and evolves migration-by-migration; the migration files double as commit history of the shape. Today, in broad strokes:

- **`diagrams`** — id, owner, name, share flag, folder fk, timestamps. The original `data` JSON column was dropped in migration 0006 once tabs moved to their own rows.
- **`tabs`** — one row per tab keyed on `(id)`, FK to `diagrams(id)` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. The body lives in a `data` JSON blob (elements + per-tab settings — theme, background, lock). Order is tracked by `order_index`. See [13-per-tab-storage.md](13-per-tab-storage.md) for why.
- **`participants`** — id, name, color. Volatile presence/status state stays on the wire.
- **`share_links`** — code → diagramId + role. Multiple links per diagram are supported; revoking a link is a row delete.
- **`change_log`** — per-diagram audit entries that drive the Activity Panel + Revert path. See [12-activity-and-audit.md](12-activity-and-audit.md).
- **`folders`** — id, owner, name, optional self-referential `parent_id`. Diagrams reference a folder via `diagrams.folder_id`. Both FKs `ON DELETE SET NULL` so deleting a folder promotes its children. Cycle prevention is enforced in the API layer (D1 can't declaratively).
- **`shared_with`** (migration 0010) — `(owner_id, diagram_id, role, last_seen)`, primary key on `(owner_id, diagram_id)`. Tracks which diagrams a non-owner has accessed via a share link so the Explorer can render a "Shared with you" accordion. FK to `diagrams` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` so deleting / revoking a diagram drops every visitor's reference for free.

Document-store hybrid: meta + folder + share state lives in real columns; element content lives in tab `data` JSON. Element-level SQL filtering isn't a use case today, so normalising element rows would buy nothing — and the editor already round-trips JSON for every save.

## One-time setup

Before the first deploy:

1. `pnpm --filter @livediagram/api exec wrangler d1 create livediagram`
2. Copy the printed `database_id` into `apps/api/wrangler.toml` (replacing `TODO_RUN_WRANGLER_D1_CREATE`).
3. `pnpm --filter @livediagram/api run db:migrate:remote` to apply migrations.

After that, GitHub Actions handles deploys via `deploy.yml` (`deploy-api` step). The router's service binding to `livediagram-api` means the API must deploy before the router.
