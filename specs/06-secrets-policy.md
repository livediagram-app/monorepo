# Secrets policy

**This repository is public.** Source code is visible to the world. Therefore:

> **No secret may ever live in source code.** No API keys, no tokens, no passwords, no OAuth client secrets, no signing keys, no service-account JSON.

This is non-negotiable. The same rule applies to README examples, test fixtures, comments, and commit history.

## Where secrets go

| Environment            | Mechanism                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local development      | `.env.local` (gitignored) per app/worker                          |
| Cloudflare Workers     | `wrangler secret put` — never in `wrangler.toml`                  |
| Cloudflare Pages       | Project env vars in the Cloudflare dashboard                      |
| CI / Deploy            | GitHub repo secrets — see below                                   |
| Client-side JS bundles | **Only** values prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` that are safe to publish |

### GitHub Actions secrets

Required by the CI/CD pipeline (see [10-deployment.md](10-deployment.md)):

| Secret          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CF_API_TOKEN`  | Cloudflare API token with permission to deploy Workers (Account → Workers Scripts → Edit + Account Settings → Read). Scoped to the account that owns the workers. |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account ID (not a secret per se, but kept in the same store).                                                                                          |

Future Pro/Cloud features will add: `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY` and any D1 binding tokens. All same rules: never in source, never in `wrangler.toml`.

## What is "safe to publish" client-side

Some keys are designed to be public; they go in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars and end up in the bundle:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — Clerk publishable key.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — Stripe publishable key.
- Public URLs (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, etc.).

If a value's documentation calls it "public", "publishable", or "client", it's fine for client bundles.

## What must stay server-side

Never imported in client code, never bundled into the static export:

- Clerk **secret** key.
- Stripe **secret** key.
- Resend API key.
- D1 database access (always via a Worker; the browser never holds DB credentials).
- Any signing / encryption key.

Workers and server-only code read these from `env` bindings — not from `process.env`-style imports in shared code.

## `.env.example`

Each app or worker that needs env vars ships a `.env.example` documenting **which variables are required** with placeholder values:

```
# Required for production builds
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
# (no secret keys here — those go in the Cloudflare dashboard)
```

`.env.local` is gitignored. `.env.example` is committed.

## If a secret leaks

1. **Rotate immediately** in the relevant provider (Clerk, Stripe, Cloudflare, etc.).
2. Update the secret in the env-var store (`wrangler secret put`, Pages dashboard).
3. Force-push and `git filter-repo` are **not** sufficient — rotation comes first because Git history is forever public.
4. Open a tracking note in specs (or wherever incidents live, TBD) to document what leaked, when, and what was rotated.

## Tooling (to be added)

- Pre-commit hook scanning for likely secrets (`gitleaks` or similar) — to be added when there are enough secrets in dev that scanning earns its keep.
- CI check that no `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`-bundled value matches a known secret-key prefix (e.g. `sk_`, Resend's `re_`).
