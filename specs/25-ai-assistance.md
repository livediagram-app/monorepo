# 25 — AI Assistance

## Overview

An optional AI assistant panel in the diagram editor. Disabled by default; users opt in
via Settings. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be configured in the api worker environment —
if absent the feature is **hidden entirely** (no UI surface, no API routes respond). This
keeps the OSS/self-host promise intact: contributors who don't want to provision an
OpenAI key get zero AI surface with no extra code paths to reason about.

## Capability detection

`GET /api/capabilities` returns `{ "aiEnabled": boolean }`. No auth required. The live
app fetches this once at editor mount; if `aiEnabled: false` the AI toggle in Settings and
the AI panel are never rendered.

## Modes

| Mode         | What it does                                                                                     | Response                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Generate** | Adds new elements and/or modifies existing ones per the prompt (labelled **Build** in the panel) | JSON `{ elements }` — appended + replaced elements |
| **Clean**    | Fixes label typos, normalises sizes/positions/styles                                             | JSON `{ elements }` — full element list cleaned    |
| **Review**   | Gives textual feedback on structure and content                                                  | `text/event-stream` SSE (streamed)                 |
| **Ask**      | Answers questions about the diagram (read-only Q&A)                                              | `text/event-stream` SSE (streamed)                 |

## Context

The elements sent to the AI depend on the current editor selection:

- One or more elements selected → send only those elements.
- Nothing selected → send all elements on the current (active) tab.

Only the **active tab** is ever in scope — other tabs are never sent.

## Security

- Auth required: Clerk JWT or `X-Owner-Id`. The hosted deployment additionally requires
  Clerk (see `AI_REQUIRE_CLERK` below); self-hosters can accept anonymous owners by
  leaving the flag unset.
- Per-IP rate limiter (`AI_RATE_LIMITER` binding, 20 req/60 s). Optional — absent on
  self-host deployments falls through to "allow", matching the pattern used by
  `WRITE_RATE_LIMITER` and `EVENTS_RATE_LIMITER`.
- Optional `Origin` allow-list (`AI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`). When set, every `/api/ai` request
  must carry an `Origin` header whose value matches one of the entries; otherwise the
  worker returns `403 { error: 'origin_not_allowed' }` before reaching OpenAI. Unset =
  no origin check (preserves the historical behaviour). The hosted deployment locks this
  down to `https://livediagram.app`; self-hosters set it to their own hostname (plus dev
  origins like `http://localhost:3002` if they want local dev to keep working).
- Optional Clerk-only gate (`AI_REQUIRE_CLERK`). When set to `"true"`, `/api/ai` rejects
  any request without a verified Clerk Bearer JWT with `401 { error: 'sign_in_required' }`;
  the legacy `X-Owner-Id` guest path still works for every OTHER endpoint, just not for
  AI. Unset = guests can still use AI (the default before this flag landed), preserving
  the OSS self-host story where Clerk is optional. Combined with the origin allow-list,
  this is the spend-DoS defence on a public deployment: a third-party site can no longer
  drain the operator's OpenAI budget by minting fresh `X-Owner-Id` UUIDs.
- Prompt capped at 1 000 characters server-side; element payload capped at 200 elements.
  Both prevent runaway token costs and context-window stuffing.
- System prompt explicitly instructs the model to refuse any request unrelated to diagram
  creation/editing and to return a structured error rather than comply.
- For mutating modes `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` is set on the OpenAI
  request so the model can only return parseable JSON, preventing injection of arbitrary
  text through the diagram data layer.
- Max-token caps: mutating modes (generate / clean) 4 000, text modes (review / ask) 600.

## API

### `GET /api/capabilities`

No auth required. Response:

```json
{ "aiEnabled": true }
```

`aiEnabled` is `true` iff `env.OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the worker environment.

### `POST /api/ai`

Auth required (Clerk Bearer JWT **or** `X-Owner-Id`).

Request body:

```json
{
  "mode": "generate" | "clean" | "review" | "ask",
  "prompt": "string (max 1 000 chars)",
  "elements": [...],
  "tabName": "string"
}
```

`elements` is an `Element[]` from `@livediagram/diagram` — either the selected subset or
the full active tab, computed client-side before the request.

Response for **mutating modes** (generate / clean):

```json
{ "elements": [...] }
```

- `generate`: a mix of **appended** elements (fresh IDs) and **modified** ones (existing
  IDs, replaced in place) — the prompt decides which. This is the former separate "amend"
  mode folded in: generate now adds, edits, or does both in one response.
- `clean`: elements to **replace by ID** (same IDs as input; new IDs = append).

Response for **review** and **ask**: `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, OpenAI SSE format
piped directly from the OpenAI API with CORS headers added.

Error responses follow the standard worker envelope:
`{ "error": "ai_not_configured" | "ai_error" | "ai_parse_error" | "off_topic" | ... }`

## Environment variables

| Variable             | Where                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Worker secret         | Required to enable AI. Absent = feature hidden.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`       | Worker var (optional) | OpenAI model name. Defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `AI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Worker var (optional) | Comma-separated `Origin` values that may call `/api/ai`. Unset = no check. Example: `https://livediagram.app,http://localhost:3002`. Entries are matched case-sensitive against the request's `Origin` header verbatim. |
| `AI_REQUIRE_CLERK`   | Worker var (optional) | Set to `"true"` to require a verified Clerk JWT on `/api/ai` (rejects the `X-Owner-Id` guest path with 401). Unset / any other value = guests allowed.                                                                  |

Set via `wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY` for production; drop into `apps/api/.dev.vars`
for local dev (gitignored). The two `AI_*` flags are plain `[vars]` (no secret value), so
operators can set them via `wrangler.toml`, the Cloudflare dashboard, or `.dev.vars` for
local testing.

## Frontend

### User preference

`aiAssistanceEnabled?: boolean` added to `UserPreferences` (spec/20 storage pattern).
Missing / `false` = panel hidden. Only shown in Settings when `capabilities.aiEnabled`.

### `useCapabilities` hook

Fetches `GET /api/capabilities` once at editor mount. Returns `{ aiEnabled: boolean }`.
On network failure defaults to `{ aiEnabled: false }` (fail-closed). The hook takes an
`enabled` flag so the call is deferred while a visitor is behind a share-link password
gate (spec/24): on a password-protected diagram, capabilities (and the server-side
preferences sync) don't fire until the correct password is entered, so wrong attempts
cost no extra requests.

### AI Panel

A floating, draggable panel rendered over the canvas via `MovablePanel` (drag to
reposition; reset returns it to its default spot). It's surfaced from the **Assistant**
accordion in the Editor side panel, and on mobile through the bottom dock popover. Visible
when `capabilities.aiEnabled && userPreferences.aiAssistanceEnabled`. Hidden in read-only /
view-role sessions (AI mutates the diagram; guests can't persist changes they don't own).

Contains:

- Mode selector (Build / Ask / Review / Clean tabs; "Build" is the `generate` mode)
- Scrollable response / status area
- Prompt textarea + Send button (disabled while a request is in flight)
- Close button (hides for the session without touching the preference)

### Undo

AI-applied element changes land as a single undo block via `commit()`, which snapshots
history before applying the mapper. One Ctrl+Z undoes the entire AI operation.

## Telemetry

`track('AI', 'Used', mode)` fires on each successful request (after the response is
received / streaming completes). Fires before any error handling so off-topic refusals
don't inflate the count.

## Out of scope (this spec)

- Multi-tab context
- Conversation history / multi-turn sessions
- Image or freehand element generation
- Per-user cost attribution or quota
- Model switching in the UI
