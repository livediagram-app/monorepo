# 25 — AI Assistance

## Overview

An optional AI assistant panel in the diagram editor. Disabled by default; users opt in
via Settings. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be configured in the api worker environment —
if absent the feature is **hidden entirely** (no UI surface, no API routes respond). This
keeps the OSS/self-host promise intact: contributors who don't want to provision an
OpenAI key get zero AI surface with no extra code paths to reason about.

## Capability detection

`GET /api/capabilities` returns `{ "aiEnabled": boolean }`. No auth required. The live
app fetches this once at editor mount; if `aiEnabled: false` the AI toggle in Settings and
the AI panel are never rendered.

## Modes

Two modes. The old **Generate** (labelled **Build**) and **Review** modes were removed: a
capable model in an external AI tool generates far better via the MCP server (spec/62), so
the built-in assistant focuses on the two things it does well against the active tab —
answering questions and tidying.

| Mode      | What it does                                         | Response                                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ask**   | Answers questions about the diagram (read-only Q&A)  | `text/event-stream` SSE (text deltas)              |
| **Clean** | Fixes label typos, normalises sizes/positions/styles | `text/event-stream` SSE; client parses JSON on end |

Both modes stream: the worker pipes OpenAI's SSE through unchanged so the panel can render progress (text deltas for Ask, a "thinking" indicator for the JSON Clean mode). The client buffers the Clean stream until completion, parses it, then applies the elements via `commit()` so undo still treats the change as one block.

## Context

The full element list on the active tab is always sent, plus an explicit `focusIds` list pointing at the currently-selected elements (empty when the user has nothing selected). The system prompt tells the model to focus its edits on the focused IDs while treating the rest as read-only context, except where arrow connections require adjusting an out-of-focus element. This sends more tokens than a strict "selection only" cut would, but gives the model the structural context it needs to keep the diagram coherent (e.g. seeing an arrow's other endpoint when only one end is in focus).

Only the **active tab** is ever in scope, other tabs are never sent.

## Conversation history

Each AI request optionally includes a `history` array of prior `{ role, content }` turns from the same panel session. The worker caps it at the most recent **6 turns** server-side (`MAX_HISTORY_TURNS`) so an extra-long session can't blow the context window. The panel maintains the history client-side and clears it when the user closes the panel or starts a new mode.

## Security

- Auth required: Clerk JWT or `X-Owner-Id`. The hosted deployment additionally requires
  Clerk (see `AI_REQUIRE_CLERK` below); self-hosters can accept anonymous owners by
  leaving the flag unset.
- Per-IP rate limiter (`AI_RATE_LIMITER` binding, 20 req/60 s). Optional — absent on
  self-host deployments falls through to "allow", matching the pattern used by
  `WRITE_RATE_LIMITER` and `EVENTS_RATE_LIMITER`.
- Optional `Origin` allow-list (`AI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`). When set, every `/api/ai` request
  must carry an `Origin` header whose value matches one of the entries; otherwise the
  worker returns `403 { error: 'origin_not_allowed' }` before reaching OpenAI. Unset =
  no origin check (preserves the historical behaviour). The hosted deployment locks this
  down to `https://livediagram.app`; self-hosters set it to their own hostname (plus dev
  origins like `http://localhost:3002` if they want local dev to keep working).
- Optional Clerk-only gate (`AI_REQUIRE_CLERK`). When set to `"true"`, `/api/ai` rejects
  any request without a verified Clerk Bearer JWT with `401 { error: 'sign_in_required' }`;
  the legacy `X-Owner-Id` guest path still works for every OTHER endpoint, just not for
  AI. Unset = guests can still use AI (the default before this flag landed), preserving
  the OSS self-host story where Clerk is optional. Combined with the origin allow-list,
  this is the spend-DoS defence on a public deployment: a third-party site can no longer
  drain the operator's OpenAI budget by minting fresh `X-Owner-Id` UUIDs.
- Prompt capped at 1 000 characters server-side; element payload capped at 200 elements.
  Both prevent runaway token costs and context-window stuffing.
- System prompt explicitly instructs the model to refuse any request unrelated to diagram
  creation/editing and to return a structured error rather than comply.
- For the mutating mode (Clean) `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` is set on the
  OpenAI request so the model can only return parseable JSON, preventing injection of
  arbitrary text through the diagram data layer.
- Max-token caps: the mutating mode (Clean) 8 000, the text mode (Ask) 400.

## API

### `GET /api/capabilities`

No auth required. Response:

```json
{ "aiEnabled": true }
```

`aiEnabled` is `true` iff `env.OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the worker environment.

### `POST /api/ai`

Auth required (Clerk Bearer JWT **or** `X-Owner-Id`).

Request body:

```json
{
  "mode": "clean" | "ask",
  "prompt": "string (max 1 000 chars)",
  "elements": [...],
  "tabName": "string",
  "focusIds": ["elementId", ...],
  "history": [{ "role": "user" | "assistant", "content": "..." }, ...]
}
```

`elements` is the full active-tab `Element[]` from `@livediagram/diagram`. `focusIds` is the optional list of selected element IDs; the system prompt steers the model toward editing those while preserving everything else. `history` is the optional prior-turn list (capped server-side at the last 6 turns); both fields default to `[]`.

Response for **both modes**: `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, OpenAI SSE format piped through with CORS headers added. The JSON-mode payload (Clean) is collected by the client into a single `{ elements: [...] }` block on stream completion:

- `clean`: elements to **replace by ID** (same IDs as input; new IDs = append).
- `ask`: SSE text deltas rendered straight into the panel as they arrive.

**Client-side normalisation.** As elements are parsed out of the stream (`extractElementsFromBuffer`, `apps/live/lib/api/ai.ts`), each shape is normalised so the result renders consistently: a shape with no `textSize` (or `"scale"`) is pinned to `"md"`. Without this the canvas default for an unset size is `'scale'` (auto-fit), so a generated node with no explicit size balloons its label to fill the box while sized siblings stay small — the classic "inconsistent font sizes" output. The model's explicit `sm`/`md`/`lg` hierarchy is preserved; only missing / `scale` sizes are rewritten. The system prompt is also strict that every shape must carry an explicit `textSize` (never omit, never `scale`) and that siblings at the same tier share one size, but the normalisation is the safety net regardless of what the model returns.

## Deterministic auto-layout

`Clean` never re-flows: it preserves the layout the user arranged and only tidies sizes,
labels, and styles in place. With **Generate** removed, the AI assistant no longer produces
fresh graphs, so it runs no auto-layout pass. The deterministic layout engine itself —
`autoLayoutElements` (`packages/diagram/src/auto-layout.ts`, pure + unit-tested) — still
exists and is now driven by the MCP server (spec/62), where the calling model produces the
graph and the server lays it out on request. (`mergeAiElements` in `editor-page-helpers.ts`
retains a general clean/replace merge; the Clean path spreads the AI patch over each
existing element, preserving AI-invisible properties and positions.)

Error responses follow the standard worker envelope:
`{ "error": "ai_not_configured" | "ai_error" | "ai_parse_error" | "off_topic" | ... }`

## Environment variables

| Variable             | Where                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Worker secret         | Required to enable AI. Absent = feature hidden.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`       | Worker var (optional) | OpenAI model name. Defaults to `gpt-4o`.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `AI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Worker var (optional) | Comma-separated `Origin` values that may call `/api/ai`. Unset = no check. Example: `https://livediagram.app,http://localhost:3002`. Entries are matched case-sensitive against the request's `Origin` header verbatim. |
| `AI_REQUIRE_CLERK`   | Worker var (optional) | Set to `"true"` to require a verified Clerk JWT on `/api/ai` (rejects the `X-Owner-Id` guest path with 401). Unset / any other value = guests allowed.                                                                  |

Set via `wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY` for production; drop into `apps/api/.dev.vars`
for local dev (gitignored). The two `AI_*` flags are plain `[vars]` (no secret value), so
operators can set them via `wrangler.toml`, the Cloudflare dashboard, or `.dev.vars` for
local testing.

## Frontend

### User preference

`aiAssistanceEnabled?: boolean` added to `UserPreferences` (spec/20 storage pattern).
Missing / `false` = panel hidden. Only shown in Settings when `capabilities.aiEnabled`.

### `useCapabilities` hook

Fetches `GET /api/capabilities` once at editor mount. Returns `{ aiEnabled: boolean }`.
On network failure defaults to `{ aiEnabled: false }` (fail-closed). The hook takes an
`enabled` flag so the call is deferred while a visitor is behind a share-link password
gate (spec/24): on a password-protected diagram, capabilities (and the server-side
preferences sync) don't fire until the correct password is entered, so wrong attempts
cost no extra requests.

### AI Panel

A floating, draggable panel rendered over the canvas via `MovablePanel` (drag to
reposition; reset returns it to its default spot). It's surfaced from the **Assistant**
accordion in the Editor side panel, and on mobile through the bottom dock popover. Visible
when `capabilities.aiEnabled && userPreferences.aiAssistanceEnabled`. Hidden in read-only /
view-role sessions (AI mutates the diagram; guests can't persist changes they don't own).

Contains:

- Mode selector (Ask / Clean tabs), with a **Connect agent** button on the right of that
  row that opens the "Connect an AI tool (MCP)" help article (spec/62) in a new tab — the
  calling model in an external tool generates far better than `/api/ai`, so the panel
  points power users there.
- **Settings gear** in the panel header (a popover mirroring the Palette / Map ones,
  `AiSettingsPopover`): **turn the AI Assistant off** (sets `aiAssistanceEnabled = false`,
  hiding the panel; the Settings dialog flips it back on), **reset position** (snap back to
  the default corner, spec/63), and a **Suggested prompts** toggle (`aiSuggestedPrompts`,
  spec/20).
- Quick suggested-prompt chips under the mode tabs, shown only when `aiSuggestedPrompts`
  is on (they're handy but take vertical space, so the gear can hide them).
- Scrollable response / status area
- Prompt textarea + Send button (disabled while a request is in flight)
- Close button (hides for the session without touching the preference)

### Undo

AI-applied element changes land as a single undo block via `commit()`, which snapshots
history before applying the mapper. One Ctrl+Z undoes the entire AI operation.

## Telemetry

`track('AI', 'Used', mode)` fires on each successful request (after the response is
received / streaming completes). Fires before any error handling so off-topic refusals
don't inflate the count.

## Out of scope (this spec)

- Multi-tab context
- Image or freehand element generation
- Per-user cost attribution or quota
- Model switching in the UI
