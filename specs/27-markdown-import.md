# Markdown import

Import a Markdown document and turn it into a real, themed diagram on a
new tab. The goal is to ingest outlines exported from other tools (XMind
mind-map → Markdown, Obsidian/Logseq outlines, any heading/bullet notes)
and produce a high-quality node-link diagram, **without assuming a fixed
shape** — the parser is tolerant of whatever structure the file has.

## Why a generic parser

Different tools emit different Markdown. XMind exports a central topic as
an `#` heading with nested `-` bullets; some tools emit all-heading
hierarchies; hand-written notes mix headings, ordered and unordered
lists, tables, and prose. We can't hard-code one layout, so the importer
extracts the **hierarchy** that's actually present and lays it out, rather
than pattern-matching a specific exporter.

## What it parses

Input is treated as a hierarchical outline:

- **ATX headings** (`#`..`######`) — depth = number of `#`. A deeper
  heading nests under the nearest shallower one.
- **List items** (`-`, `*`, `+`, `1.`, `1)`), nested by indentation
  (tabs normalised to spaces). Lists attach under the current heading;
  nested items attach under their parent item. Task-list checkboxes
  (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) are stripped to their text.
- **GFM pipe tables** (a header row followed by a `---|---` delimiter)
  become a `table` element.
- **Prose lines** become leaf nodes under the current heading (so content
  isn't silently dropped), and end the current list.
- **Skipped:** fenced code blocks (``` / ~~~) and their contents,
horizontal rules, and blockquote markers (`>` is stripped).
- **Inline formatting** in labels is flattened to plain text: bold,
  italic, strikethrough, inline code, links (→ link text), images
  (→ alt text), and raw HTML tags are removed. Long labels are capped.

If the document has a single top-level node it becomes the diagram's
root; otherwise a synthetic root (named from the file) holds the
top-level nodes so the result is one connected diagram.

## What it produces

- A **tidy left-to-right tree**: the root on the left, each level a
  column, children stacked and vertically centred on their parent so
  nothing overlaps. Boxes are sized to their label; depth drives text
  size (root largest). Parent→child links are **curved pinned arrows**.
- Any **tables** are placed in a column below the tree.
- Everything is recoloured to a theme (the active tab's theme, falling
  back to Brand) and the new tab adopts that theme's background — so the
  import looks native, not pasted-in.

The diagram is fully editable afterwards — it's ordinary elements, not a
locked import.

## How it's triggered — the Import dialog

The per-tab **"Import…"** action (tab ellipsis menu) opens an **Import
dialog**, the mirror of the Export dialog. The user picks the format:

- **livediagram file** — a `.json` tab export, restored exactly.
- **Markdown** — a `.md` outline, built into a themed tree as above.

The chosen format drives both the file-picker's filter and which parser
runs (no content auto-detection — the user said which it is).

**Import replaces the current tab's contents** — its elements, theme, and
background — keeping the tab's id and name. The dialog leads with a
warning that says so. The replace is a single `commitTabs` step, so
**Undo (⌘Z) restores** the previous content; the warning says that too.
Errors render inline in the dialog (e.g. "No headings, lists, or tables
found in this Markdown."); cancelling the file picker leaves the dialog
open. Importing is disabled (menu item greyed) while the tab is locked,
and the whole ellipsis menu is hidden for view-only visitors. Emits
`Tab / Imported / Markdown` (or `/ JSON`) telemetry (spec/22).

(This replaced the earlier behaviour where import always appended a new
tab — a format picker + an explicit "this overwrites the tab" warning is
clearer than silently growing the tab list, and Undo makes it safe.)

## Boundaries / future

- **Round-trip:** our own Markdown export (spec — `export-tab.ts`) imports
  back as a structural tree (title → Elements/Connections sections), not
  a byte-for-byte graph reconstruction. Markdown is a human _summary_;
  the faithful round-trip text format is the native DSL in
  [spec/66](66-text-dsl.md), which preserves the connection graph by id.
- **Not in scope here:** Mermaid (` ```mermaid `) fl/ graph blocks →
  real edge graphs, and Excalidraw `.excalidraw` JSON (that's JSON, not
  Markdown; a separate importer). The parser deliberately skips code
  fences today so a future Mermaid pass can claim them — tracked under
  [spec/66](66-text-dsl.md) (Boundaries).

Implementation: `apps/live/lib/markdown-import.ts` (pure parser + layout +
`buildTabFromMarkdown`, unit-tested), dynamically imported by
`useTabActions.importIntoActiveTab` (which replaces the active tab) so the
parser stays out of the initial editor bundle. The dialog is
`apps/live/components/dialogs/ImportTabDialog.tsx`. See also
[spec/05](05-diagram-structure.md) (element model) and
[spec/09](09-canvas-and-palette.md) (import/export menu).
