# 23, Marketing assets

The `marketing/` folder (repo root) holds outbound promotional material: copy
for directory listings, app stores, launch posts, and social, plus media
(logos, screenshots, social cards). It is distinct from three neighbours:

- [`specs/`](README.md) is the product source of truth (what to build).
- [`docs/`](../docs) is developer- and user-facing documentation (how to run,
  host, contribute).
- `apps/marketing` is the live landing **site** at `/` (see
  [16-marketing-site](16-marketing-site.md)); `marketing/` is the **off-site**
  copy and assets used to list and promote the product elsewhere.

## Golden rule: claims map to shipped features

Same rule as the landing page ([16](16-marketing-site.md)): every claim in
`marketing/` must correspond to something a visitor can do today. The unshipped
items in [02-prototype-scope](02-prototype-scope.md) (team workspaces,
transactional email, CRDT / conflict-free editing) must not appear, even
softened. When the editor gains or loses a feature, update the affected copy in
the same change. Counts (currently 17 templates, 18 themes, ten core shapes)
must match their source of truth, as pinned by the live app's tests.

## Layout

```
marketing/
  README.md              what the folder is for + house style
  copy/
    facts.md             canonical fact sheet; all copy derives from it
    taglines.md          one-liners bucketed by character budget
    descriptions.md      blurbs bucketed by word / character budget
  media/                 logos, screenshots, social cards (see media/README.md)
```

`copy/facts.md` is the single source the taglines and descriptions are built
from. Change a fact there first, then propagate. The other copy files annotate
each variant with its length budget so a listing field's limit maps to a ready
variant (for example a 35-char tagline slot uses a `<= 30` line; a 500-word
listing body uses the ~500-word description).

## Tone & brand

Inherits [16](16-marketing-site.md) and [00-purpose](00-purpose.md): plain,
confident, understated; multiplayer-from-the-start diagramming for teams who
think visually. Lead with the hook: the canvas works without signing in (open a
link, draw, share). Be honest about trade-offs (realtime is last-write-wins,
not CRDT). Say "free, MIT-licensed, self-hostable, no paid tier" where the
format allows ([03](03-open-source-and-business-model.md)). Product name
**livediagram** (lowercase); brand colour sky-blue `#0EA5E9`
([01-color-scheme](01-color-scheme.md)). No em dashes in the copy.

## Media

Binary assets live under `marketing/media/` (see its README for the suggested
sub-layout and brand guidance). Prefer SVG for logos and optimised PNG / WebP
for screenshots; screenshots should show a real diagram with visible
multiplayer cursors, since "no sign-in, real-time" is the pitch. Keep heavy
binaries out of git where practical.
