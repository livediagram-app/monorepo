# Tab ↔ diagram many-to-many

## Why

Today every `tabs` row carries a single `diagram_id` FK — one tab belongs to one diagram. That works for the editor's "tabs are folders inside a diagram" mental model, but it forecloses a category of features the user has flagged for the next phase:

- **Copy a tab between diagrams** without duplicating the content (so an edit in one tab propagates to the other).
- **A reference tab** that lives in several diagrams at once — e.g. a glossary, a shared timeline, an architecture diagram that's part of two product lines' workspaces.
- **Change log without per-diagram scoping** ([spec/12](12-activity-and-audit.md) — paired with item #14): once a tab can live in multiple diagrams, attributing a change to a single `(diagram_id, tab_id)` pair stops being meaningful. The change should be on the tab; consumers join through the link table when they care which diagrams it surfaces in.

The migration sequences as items #13 → #14 → #15 → #16 in the post-prototype haul. #13 adds the link table; #14 drops the now-redundant `change_log.diagram_id`; #15 denormalises participant metadata out of `change_log`; #16 ages out old `change_log` rows on a cron.

## Data model

New table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE diagram_tabs (
  diagram_id  TEXT    NOT NULL,
  tab_id      TEXT    NOT NULL,
  order_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  added_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (diagram_id, tab_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (diagram_id) REFERENCES diagrams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (tab_id)     REFERENCES tabs(id)     ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX diagram_tabs_by_diagram ON diagram_tabs(diagram_id, order_index);
CREATE INDEX diagram_tabs_by_tab     ON diagram_tabs(tab_id);
```

`order_index` lives on the link, not on the tab — two diagrams that share a tab can order it independently. `added_at` lets us surface "added to this diagram on date X" later.

The legacy `tabs.diagram_id` and `tabs.order_index` columns stay for one phase as a transitional denormalisation: migration 0011 backfills `diagram_tabs` from them and keeps them in sync on writes. Item #14's migration will drop both columns once every read site has moved through the link table.

### Tab lifecycle

- **Create tab** — insert one row into `tabs`, one row into `diagram_tabs` pointing it at the owning diagram. The legacy `tabs.diagram_id` is set to the owning diagram for backward compat until #14 drops the column.
- **Add tab to another diagram** — `INSERT INTO diagram_tabs (diagram_id, tab_id, order_index, added_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)`. No change to `tabs`. Edits to the tab propagate to every diagram referencing it.
- **Remove tab from a diagram** — `DELETE FROM diagram_tabs WHERE diagram_id = ? AND tab_id = ?`. If no rows remain referencing the tab AND the tab is in no other live diagram, the `tabs` row itself is dropped in a follow-up step (or left dangling and cleaned up by the cron at #16's cadence — TBD).
- **Delete a diagram** — `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `diagrams` removes every link row; the underlying tabs survive if other diagrams still reference them.

## API impact

`GET /api/diagrams/:id` returns the diagram with its tab summaries — the join now goes through `diagram_tabs`:

```sql
SELECT t.id, t.name, dt.order_index
  FROM diagram_tabs dt
  JOIN tabs t ON t.id = dt.tab_id
 WHERE dt.diagram_id = ?
 ORDER BY dt.order_index ASC
```

`PUT /api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId` (tab body write) is unchanged on the surface but the implementation no longer scopes by `diagram_id` to find the row — the tab id is globally unique. The caller's permission to edit the tab is still gated by their permission on at least one diagram that contains it (owner of any containing diagram, OR an edit-role share code for any containing diagram).

`POST /api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId/link` adds an existing tab into the target diagram. Idempotent: same `(diagram_id, tab_id)` pair returns 200 without duplicating the link row (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). Auth: caller must own the target diagram AND own at least one diagram that already contains the tab (so a stranger can't graft a tab they have no read access to). Returns the resulting tab summary. The TabBar's "Add to another diagram..." menu uses this endpoint; subsequent edits on either side write to the same `tabs.data` row, so changes propagate.

`DELETE /api/diagrams/:id/tabs/:tabId` now removes the link row first, then drops the underlying `tabs` row only when no other `diagram_tabs` entries reference it. Unlinking a shared tab from one diagram leaves the body intact for the others.

`POST /api/diagrams/:id/copy` (item #9) copies tab bodies into freshly minted tab rows — that doesn't change. The new tab rows get fresh ids and their own `diagram_tabs` entries pointing at the new diagram. Cloning vs linking is a deliberate distinction: copy = independent content, link = shared content.

## Phasing

This spec describes the destination. The implementation lands in stages so each can be tested in isolation:

1. **Migration 0011** — add `diagram_tabs`, backfill from `tabs.diagram_id` / `tabs.order_index`. Reads start going through the link table; writes update both the link table AND the legacy columns. No surface change. Done in this commit.
2. **Item #14 — drop `change_log.diagram_id`** — change_log entries already key by `tab_id`; the `diagram_id` was just denormalisation. Migration drops the column, queries that filtered by `diagram_id` now derive the diagram set via `diagram_tabs`.
3. **Item #15 — drop denormalised participant metadata from `change_log`** — `participant_name` and `participant_color` columns were copy-on-write snapshots for offline-friendly reads. Drop and join through `participants` on read instead.
4. **Item #16 — 90-day `change_log` cron** — daily worker cron deletes `change_log` rows older than 90 days. Capacity guard against unbounded growth as collab traffic ramps up.
5. **Drop `tabs.diagram_id` + `tabs.order_index`** (separate migration, after all read sites have moved off the legacy path).

- [spec/11](11-api.md) — endpoint dispatch + the underlying schema overview. Updated alongside the migration in #13.
- [spec/12](12-activity-and-audit.md) — change_log shape. Updated in #14 + #15.
- [spec/13](13-per-tab-storage.md) — the per-tab storage rationale. Still applies; the link table is orthogonal to where the tab body lives.
