# Auth + guest access

## Principle

**The canvas always works without signing in.** A first-time visitor can land on `/new`, create a diagram, build something real, and only later be asked to sign up. This is intentional — friction-free engagement is the acquisition strategy.

We don't put auth in front of the core experience. We add auth where it _enables_ something the user wants (sharing, syncing, collaborating, paying).

## Three deployment modes

| Mode                 | Configuration                                                      | Frontend                                                                                                   | API worker                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Hybrid (production)  | `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` set + `CLERK_JWKS_URL` set     | ClerkProvider active. Guests + signed-in users coexist.                                                    | Verifies Bearer, falls through to `X-Owner-Id`. |
| Guest-only           | Either env var unset (typical self-host without Clerk per spec/03) | ClerkProvider becomes pass-through. Auth routes show "not enabled" notice. Editor unchanged.               | Falls through to `X-Owner-Id` on every request. |
| Guest-only (partial) | Frontend has key, api JWKS unset                                   | ClerkProvider active. Users _can_ sign in, but the api verifies nothing and treats every request as guest. | `X-Owner-Id` only.                              |

The first two are the supported modes. The third is a misconfiguration — useful for debugging, not for prod.

The `clerkEnabled` flag (`apps/live/lib/clerk-config.ts`) is the single source of truth on the frontend. Every Clerk-aware module reads it and picks one of two implementations at module load:

- `ClerkProvider` becomes a pass-through `<>{children}</>`.
- `useClerkApiBootstrap` returns a stable stub (`isSignedIn: false`, `authLoaded: true`, `clerkUserId: null`) without ever touching `useAuth`.
- `AuthControls` renders nothing.
- `/sign-in/`, `/get-started/`, `/sso-callback/` render an `AuthDisabledNotice` with a "Continue as guest" CTA.

Because `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are baked at build time, the choice is a compile-time constant — no per-render cost and Clerk-only code paths can be tree-shaken out of guest-only builds.

## Hybrid identity

The api worker accepts **two equivalent ways** of identifying the request owner, in this order of preference:

1. **Clerk Bearer JWT** — `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Verified against `env.CLERK_JWKS_URL` in `apps/api/src/auth/clerk.ts` (using `jose`'s `createRemoteJWKSet` + `jwtVerify`). The token's `sub` claim is the owner id.
2. **Guest header** — `X-Owner-Id: <participant-id>`. The participant id is a `crypto.randomUUID()` minted on first visit and persisted in `localStorage` under `livediagram:v2:self-id`.

When both are present the Bearer wins. When verification fails (expired token, missing JWKS URL, etc.) the worker silently falls through to the guest header — never 401, because the guest path must always serve.

The two paths coexist forever. A signed-in user can hand a share link to a guest who edits without auth.

## Auth surface

Four routes inside `apps/live/`:

- **`/sign-in/`** — email-code, plus an optional Google OAuth button gated on `googleOAuthEnabled` (`apps/live/lib/clerk-config.ts`); the flag currently ships off so the button doesn't render, pending the Google Cloud OAuth client being configured against Clerk's redirect URI. On success (and for an already-signed-in visitor) it lands on the **Explorer** (`/explorer`) by default — a returning user wants to see their existing diagrams, not the new-diagram welcome flow — via `POST_AUTH_SIGNIN_DEFAULT` in `components/auth-shared.tsx`. A valid `?redirect_url` still wins (see below).
- **`/get-started/`** — sign-up (first name + last name + email + 6-digit code), with the same flag-gated Google OAuth button. Same post-auth destination.
- **`?redirect_url=...`** — Clerk's protected-page bounce passes this query param to both routes, and BOTH the email-code AND OAuth paths honour it. Routes are clean now (no `/live` prefix — spec/08), so a valid `redirect_url` is any **same-origin path**. Two helpers in `components/auth-shared.tsx` share the same validation (`isSafeInternalPath`): the path must start with a single `/` — NOT `//` or `/\` (the protocol-relative / backslash open-redirect tricks the old `/live`-prefix check guarded against implicitly) — and must not point back at `/sign-in` or `/get-started` (loop guard):
  - `resolvePostAuthDestination(searchParams)` returns the safe path as-is for `router.push` (email-code path) — there's no basePath to strip any more.
  - `resolveOAuthCompleteUrl(searchParams)` returns the same destination for Clerk's `authenticateWithRedirect({ redirectUrlComplete })` (OAuth path) — with clean routing there's no `/live` prefix to re-add, so it just mirrors `resolvePostAuthDestination`.
    When `redirect_url` is missing, unsafe, or pointing at an auth route, each flow falls back to its own default: **sign-in → the Explorer** (`POST_AUTH_SIGNIN_DEFAULT`, `/explorer/recent`), **sign-up → the welcome / new-diagram flow** (`POST_AUTH_DEFAULT`, `/new`). The default is passed into the shared resolvers, so a valid protected-page bounce still returns a user sent to sign-in OR sign-up, via email-code OR OAuth, back where they came from.
- **`/sso-callback/`** — Clerk's `AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback` for the OAuth round-trip.
- **`/explorer/`**: standalone full-page Explorer (item #12). Open to both guests and signed-in users: the owner id resolves the same way every other surface in the live app does (Clerk userId when signed in, the `livediagram:v2:self-id` localStorage UUID otherwise), so a guest sees the diagrams + folders + Image Gallery their per-browser id owns. Reached from the AuthControls dropdown's "Explorer" menu item (the same label spec/07 uses for the mobile entry point) or the floating Explorer panel's expand affordance. Signed-out visitors get the same "Sign in" CTA as everywhere else (AuthControls in the page header), the page itself doesn't gate. Guest data is per-browser by definition (no cross-device sync until they sign up and migrate).

The shared card chrome and inputs live in `apps/live/components/auth-shared.tsx` so the two pages don't drift.

Signed-in status surfaces in the editor header via `<AuthControls>` (initial bubble + Sign out menu). Signed-out users see a "Sign in" link in the same slot. Neither blocks the editor — they're purely informational.

## Identity display name

A signed-in user's participant `name` is driven by their Clerk profile (`firstName + lastName`, falling back to `fullName` then `username`). On every editor mount we seed the participant record with the current Clerk name, and re-`PUT` it whenever it has drifted from the persisted value — so renaming yourself in Clerk propagates to denormalised activity-log rows on the next load.

Two welcome-modal rules follow from that:

- **Owner on their own diagram**: the identity-only welcome screen never opens. The user's identity is already settled by Clerk; prompting them to pick a display name on a diagram they own would be noise.
- **Visitor on someone else's diagram (signed in)**: the welcome screen still opens (it carries the "you're joining X's diagram" context), but the "Your name" input is `readOnly` and the shuffle button hides. Visitors who _are_ signed in can't masquerade under a different display name on a host's diagram.

Guests see the legacy behaviour in both cases — first-load identity prompt, fully editable name, shuffle button present.

The join prompt is **independent of share role**: both **edit-role and view-role** visitors get it. A viewer's display name is broadcast to everyone else (cursor label, the tab presence stack, comments), so they need a chance to set it before joining rather than appearing under a random default. The identity card only writes the visitor's **own** participant row (`PUT /api/participants/:id`, authorised on `owner === id`, not on diagram-edit rights), so confirming a name never hits a `403` even for a read-only viewer. The card's edit-only affordances (template grid, theme grid) don't render in identity mode, so there's nothing a viewer could trigger that they lack permission for.

## Guest → account migration

When a guest signs up, the diagrams they built as a guest **migrate into their account** rather than being lost. They've already invested effort — losing it on sign-up would be the opposite of friction-free.

Mechanism (see also [spec/11 — `POST /api/migrate`](11-api.md)):

1. The editor + new-diagram pages mount with a `useEffect` that watches `isSignedIn + clerkUserId` from `useAuth`.
2. The first time both are truthy AND `livediagram:v2:self-id` is still in `localStorage` AND the stored id differs from the Clerk userId, the page calls `POST /api/migrate { guestOwnerId: <localStorage id>, guestSignature: <localStorage signature> }` with the Clerk Bearer token.
3. The worker (Clerk-only auth, no `X-Owner-Id` fallback for this endpoint) **verifies the guest id's HMAC signature** (possession proof — see "Signed guest ids" below) and then reassigns every `diagrams.owner_id`, `folders.owner_id`, `shared_with.owner_id`, `user_preferences.owner_id`, and `images.owner_id` row from the guest id to the Clerk userId. `shared_with` and `user_preferences` both use `INSERT OR IGNORE` + `DELETE` rather than a straight `UPDATE`: `shared_with`'s primary key is `(owner_id, diagram_id)`, and `user_preferences`'s primary key is `owner_id` alone, so in both cases a Clerk row that already exists (the visitor accepted the same share link both as guest and signed-in; or the user signed in on another device first and already had a preferences row) would otherwise raise a PK conflict on a naive `UPDATE`. The IGNORE keeps the existing Clerk row's data, which is the more recent / authoritative copy in both tables. `images` carries a `UNIQUE (owner_id, sha256)` index for dedupe, so it uses `UPDATE OR IGNORE`: rows whose sha256 already exists under the Clerk userId (the user uploaded the same bytes under both identities) stay at the guest owner so their `image.id` keeps resolving for any formerly-guest diagram that references it, via the existing diagram-reference fallback in `GET /api/images/:id` (spec/19). Only the gallery list filters by owner, so the dedupe-loser disappears from the listing but the canvas keeps rendering. Other tables (`change_log`, `share_links`, `tabs`) link via `diagram_id`, so they cascade for free.
4. On success the page removes the localStorage key. The migration is idempotent — a retry with the same `guestOwnerId` simply moves zero rows.

Participants are not migrated. The participant row is owner-less in the schema; signed-in users get a fresh participant record keyed by their Clerk userId on first save. A guest's name + colour don't survive — small cosmetic regression that's not worth a second endpoint to fix.

### Signed guest ids (migrate possession proof)

A guest's `X-Owner-Id` is a bearer value that **leaks**: it rides in diagram DTOs and realtime presence frames. Without a possession proof, `POST /api/migrate` trusted a body-supplied `guestOwnerId` outright, so anyone who merely _observed_ a victim's guest id could reassign all of that guest's diagrams / folders / images into their own account. To close this, guest ids are HMAC-signed:

- **Server-minted.** When `GUEST_ID_HMAC_SECRET` is set, the live app calls `POST /api/guest-id` during identity bootstrap; the worker **generates** the id and returns it with its HMAC signature (`auth/owner-signature.ts`). Because the server chooses the id, a caller can only ever hold a signature for an id the server handed _them_ — never for an id observed elsewhere. The signature is cached in `localStorage` under `livediagram:v2:self-sig` and is **never** returned in any DTO or presence frame; only the bare id is.
- **Verified on migrate.** `POST /api/migrate` requires a valid signature for the source guest id before reassigning ownership. Knowing the id is no longer enough.
- **Defence in depth.** The share resolver no longer returns the owner's id to non-owner visitors (`redactOwner`), removing the easiest observation vector.
- **Optional (self-host).** When `GUEST_ID_HMAC_SECRET` is unset, signing is disabled and migrate keeps its legacy unsigned behaviour — fine for a single-user self-host. Production sets the secret (provisioned like `CLERK_JWKS_URL`).
- **Legacy upgrade.** A guest created before signing shipped has an unsigned id and so can't satisfy the check. On the next editor load the bootstrap mints a signed id and migrates the old data onto it via a guest→guest migrate (flow 2, authenticated by the old id as `X-Owner-Id` — the same bearer credential every guest request uses; if it fails the old id is kept so nothing is orphaned). **Residual:** this guest→guest step is only bearer-authenticated, so a legacy (pre-signing) id that an attacker already captured via presence could be claimed during the transition window. New guests are never exposed; the window shrinks to nothing as legacy ids age out, and the DTO leak is already closed.

## Implications for how we build

- UI must never block the canvas behind a sign-in wall.
- Features that genuinely need an account are surfaced as opt-in prompts ("Sign in to keep your diagrams"), never modal walls.
- The single persistence boundary (`apps/live/lib/api-client.ts` against the api worker — see [11-api.md](11-api.md)) is the same in guest and authenticated mode. Only the request headers differ: a `localStorage`-minted UUID in `X-Owner-Id` for guests, a Clerk JWT in `Authorization` for signed-in users. The api-client's module-level `setTokenProvider` is the single switch.
- Public client code that uses Clerk uses only the **publishable key** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`), never the secret key. See [06-secrets-policy.md](06-secrets-policy.md).
- The api worker's degraded-mode behaviour matters: with `CLERK_JWKS_URL` unset (no `[vars]` value in `wrangler.toml`), every request silently falls through to the guest path. Useful for local dev and for environments where Clerk hasn't been provisioned yet — the editor stays usable.
