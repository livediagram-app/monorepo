# 48 — Style presets

One-click style presets in the selected-element context menu, so a user can
create variety and emphasis on key elements without dialling each field by
hand. A **Presets** category sits at the top of the appearance group (above
**Animation**).

## Shapes

When a single **shape** element is right-clicked, the menu shows a **Presets**
category with two preset rows the user combines freely, plus a reset. The
dedicated **icon** glyph is excluded — it has no fill / border to preset:

- **Colour** — eight one-click colour variations derived from the active
  theme. Each preset sets the shape's fill, border (stroke) and text colour
  together. The set spans the theme's on-theme look plus soft / tinted / solid
  / bold / outline / muted / inked emphasis variants (and, on multi-colour
  themes, a card per branch hue), so the same theme yields a legible spread of
  intensities. Text colour is auto-contrasted on filled variants so labels
  stay readable.
- **Border** — up to eight border-shape variations combining weight
  (thin / medium / thick), pattern (solid / dotted / dashed) and corner radius
  (none / small / medium / large / full). Includes a sharp (un-rounded) preset
  and a rounded preset using the border-radius the Border category exposes, so
  the user can pick variety and emphasis at a glance.
- **Reset to default** — clears the shape's colour overrides back to the
  theme and removes border weight / pattern / radius overrides, returning the
  shape to its theme default in one click.

Colour and border presets are independent: applying one never disturbs the
other, so the two combine (e.g. a tinted colour with a dashed un-rounded
border).

### Colour presets track the theme

A colour preset is theme-relative, not a frozen set of hex values. When applied
to a shape we store the preset's **stable id** (e.g. `bold`, `soft`,
`branch-0`) on the shape alongside the concrete colours it wrote. Changing the
diagram's **theme** then re-derives the bound preset for the new theme — a
shape on the **Bold** preset becomes the new theme's Bold look rather than
staying pinned to the previous theme's colours. The binding is dropped the
moment the user hand-edits any of the shape's colours or resets it to theme
(at which point the preset no longer describes the shape). Starter **templates**
use this too: a template's key element ships with a `colorPreset`, so it stands
out in whatever theme the diagram is created with.

### Hover to preview (desktop)

On a desktop pointer, **hovering** a preset tile shows it **live** on the
selected element(s) so the user can compare looks at a glance; the change only
sticks on **click**. Moving the pointer off the tile reverts to the pre-hover
look. The preview is ephemeral — it never lands an undo step or an activity-log
entry, and is reverted before the click commits, so undo snapshots the true
pre-hover state and the activity entry diffs from it correctly. Touch / pen
input does not preview (a tap is the commit).

## Arrows

When a single **arrow** is right-clicked, the **Presets** category offers
eight one-click arrow styles that combine line pattern (solid / dashed /
dotted), thickness and an optional flow animation (e.g. a dashed animated
arrow, a travelling-dot arrow), plus **Reset to default**. Reset clears the
arrow's line-pattern / thickness / animation overrides.

## Implementation notes

- The category renders only in the single-element context menu, only for the
  matching element type (shape vs arrow). It is not offered in the
  multi-selection menu.
- Colour presets are theme-derived via `shapeColorPresets(theme)` in
  `apps/live/lib/themes.ts` (reusing the existing `tint` / `shade` /
  `isLightColor` colour helpers), so they always track the active theme like
  the colour-picker swatches (`themePresetColors`). Each preset carries a
  stable `id`; `shapeColorPresetById(theme, id)` / `rederiveColorPresetForTheme`
  resolve a stored id back to colours for a theme, and the theme-change paths
  (`recolourElementsForTheme` / `switchThemeElements`) call them so a
  preset-bound shape re-derives instead of being preserved as a manual
  override. The `colorPreset` binding lives on `ShapeElement` in
  `packages/diagram`.
- Border and arrow presets are static preset tables in the presets component
  (`apps/live/components/StylePresets.tsx`).
- The element transforms each preset performs live in `apps/live/lib/style-presets.ts`
  (`applyColorPresetToEl` / `applyBorderPresetToEl` / `applyArrowPresetToEl`),
  shared so the hover preview is byte-for-byte the change the click commits.
- Direct (non-preview) commits go through the selection setters in
  `apps/live/hooks/useElementStyle.ts` (`applyShapeColorPresetSelected` /
  `applyShapeBorderPresetSelected` / `resetShapeStyleSelected` /
  `applyArrowPresetSelected` / `resetArrowStyleSelected`). Hand-editing a
  colour or resetting clears the `colorPreset` binding there.
- Hover preview is owned by `apps/live/hooks/useStylePreview.ts`: preview +
  revert go through `tickTabs` (present-only, no history / no log); the click
  commit restores the originals into the present, then commits, so the undo
  snapshot and activity diff are taken from the true pre-hover state. The
  context menu wires the tiles' click → commit and pointer enter/leave →
  preview/revert (mouse pointers only).
- Telemetry (spec/22): applying / resetting a preset fires
  `track('Element', 'Changed', …)` with a `StylePreset` / `BorderPreset` /
  `ArrowPreset` / `StyleReset` type token.
