# User preferences

Per-user editor preference flags that toggle behaviour without
changing diagram content. A small Settings dialog launched from
the footer (gear button to the left of the dark-mode toggle)
exposes them. Replaces the earlier per-diagram-settings shape:
preferences are about the user's editor experience, not about any
particular diagram, so they live once per account / device and
apply everywhere.

## Where preferences live

Preferences live in **D1** as the source of truth, with
`localStorage` as a fast warm cache so the editor never blocks on
a network round-trip at boot.

- **D1 table** `user_preferences` (migration `0016_user_preferences.sql`),
  one row per owner (Clerk userId for signed-in users, the per-
  browser participant id for guests). Columns: `owner_id TEXT
PRIMARY KEY`, `prefs TEXT NOT NULL` (serialised JSON blob),
  `updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL` (Unix ms). The JSON blob shape
  keeps the migration count low when new flags arrive: adding a
  field never requires altering the table.
- **localStorage cache** keyed `livediagram:user-preferences:v1`
  (legacy key, unchanged). Read synchronously at page-load so the
  Settings dialog and gate caches (telemetry, draw-to-add, etc.)
  have a value to read before the network fetch returns.

### Sync flow

- **On editor open**: read the localStorage cache synchronously
  (zero-blocking), then fire-and-forget `GET /api/preferences`.
  When the server response arrives, merge it over the cache
  (server wins for any key present on both sides), persist back
  to localStorage, and dispatch the existing
  `livediagram:preferences-changed` window event so in-process
  listeners refresh. If the fetch fails the cache value stays
  authoritative for the session.
- **On toggle**: update localStorage immediately (so the UI
  reflects the change without waiting for the network), then
  fire-and-forget `PUT /api/preferences` with the full updated
  blob. If the PUT fails the local change still applies; the
  next page load picks the cache again. Last-write-wins per
  device.
- **Cross-tab updates**: the browser's native `storage` event on
  the preferences key still fires across tabs in the same
  browser, so toggling in one tab updates every open editor.

### Why D1 instead of localStorage-only

The original v1 shape was localStorage-only on the grounds that
flags were UI-only and a server round-trip per toggle was
overkill. That trade-off was wrong for the user experience:
signed-in users who use livediagram on a laptop and a phone had
to re-flip every setting on each device. Per-account sync is the
expected behaviour for an account-bound app.

Guests get the same persistence model (the api keys them by
their `X-Owner-Id` participant id), so server-side storage is
effectively a remote copy of localStorage for that device, but
with a cross-browser bonus: a guest who clears localStorage but
keeps the same browser session still recovers their preferences.

### Sign-up migration

`POST /api/migrate` (spec/04) moves `user_preferences.owner_id`
along with the diagrams + folders + shared-with rows, so a guest
who signs up keeps the settings they'd already chosen. Idempotent
in the same shape as the existing migrations: a second call with
the same `guestOwnerId` moves zero rows.

### Self-host degradation

When the api worker is unset (pure-guest self-host without a D1
binding configured) the client treats the fetch as a no-op
failure: the localStorage cache acts as the only persistence,
which is the same behaviour as the original v1 design and works
exactly like it did before. No required SaaS calls, self-hosting
stays viable.

## Schema

```ts
type UserPreferences = {
  // When false, the live editor skips the "re-pin connected arrow
  // anchors as elements move" pass implemented in packages/diagram's
  // `rebindArrowAnchorsAfterMove` (pinned in
  // packages/diagram/src/geometry.test.ts). Defaults to true so
  // users see the magic by default; flipping it off freezes arrow
  // anchors at whatever the user chose at draw time.
  autoRebindArrows?: boolean;

  // When false, the live editor's `track()` helper is a no-op:
  // nothing leaves the browser. Distinct from the build-time
  // NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEMETRY_ENABLED gate and from the api worker's
  // TELEMETRY_ENABLED gate (both still apply). This is the user's
  // own opt-out lever, surfaced in the Settings dialog so the
  // "first-party, no creepy tracking" claim on the landing page
  // and /telemetry is honest. Defaults to true (telemetry on);
  // setting it to false is the only state that changes behaviour.
  // See spec/22 for the rest of the telemetry contract.
  telemetryEnabled?: boolean;

  // When true, picking a shape (or tool) from the palette enters
  // a draw-to-size mode: the canvas cursor becomes a shape-aware
  // crosshair and the next drag defines the bounds of the new
  // element. Defaults to false (the historical drop-at-viewport-
  // centre behaviour). See `apps/live/components/Canvas.tsx` for
  // the PendingDraw discriminated union the gesture commits
  // through.
  drawToAdd?: boolean;
  // Pencil tool's shape-recognition toggle (spec/09 Pencil
  // subsection). When true, every freehand commit while the
  // pencil banner is up runs through recogniseShape and may
  // mint a primitive instead of a FreehandElement. Deliberately
  // NOT surfaced in the Settings dialog: the flag is a per-tool
  // toggle, set + read from the pencil ModeBanner's icon button,
  // and Settings is reserved for global editor preferences. The
  // toggle's state still persists here so flipping it once
  // sticks across sessions.
  recogniseShapes?: boolean;
};
```

Stored as serialised JSON on both sides of the wire. Unknown keys
are preserved on read so a forward-rolled client doesn't strip
another version's flags.

## Defaults

Missing key === undefined === default behaviour. Concretely:

- `autoRebindArrows` undefined → arrows rebind (the default
  behaviour). Setting it to `false` is the only state that
  changes behaviour.
- `telemetryEnabled` undefined → telemetry on (the default).
  Setting it to `false` is the only state that opts out.
- `drawToAdd` undefined → drop-at-centre placement (the default).
  Setting it to `true` flips the palette into draw-to-size mode
  for every element kind.
- `recogniseShapes` undefined → raw-sketch pencil (the default).
  Setting it to `true` makes every pencil commit attempt
  classification first. Flipped from the pencil ModeBanner icon
  button rather than from the Settings dialog.

Empty (or missing entirely) localStorage entry, AND no row in
`user_preferences` for this owner, is therefore the "everything
on" state.

## UI placement

- Settings dialog component: `apps/live/components/SettingsDialog.tsx`,
  lazy-loaded via `next/dynamic` (matches the other on-demand
  modals: ShareDialog, ExportTabDialog, ShortcutsDialog, ImagePicker).
- Trigger: a gear-icon button in the TabBar footer, sitting
  between the existing Shortcuts button and the dark-mode toggle.
  Visible in every role: view-role visitors can still flip their
  own telemetry preference and (harmlessly) their own
  auto-rebind preference, even though they can't edit elements.

## Read / write helpers

Live in `apps/live/lib/user-preferences.ts`:

- `readUserPreferences(): UserPreferences` returns the current
  cached preferences, parsing the stored JSON and defaulting any
  missing key. Returns `{}` on parse failure (graceful). Sync,
  reads localStorage only, so the editor can use it during render.
- `writeUserPreferences(prefs): void` serialises and writes back
  to localStorage AND fires a non-blocking `PUT /api/preferences`
  with the full blob. Also dispatches a
  `livediagram:preferences-changed` window event so same-tab
  listeners (notably `lib/telemetry.ts`) can refresh their cached
  gate without polling.
- `fetchUserPreferences(): Promise<UserPreferences | null>` does
  a single `GET /api/preferences`. Returns null on failure or
  when the api worker is unreachable. Callers use this once at
  editor mount to reconcile with the server.

Cross-tab updates are picked up via the browser's native `storage`
event on the preferences key.

## API

- **`GET /api/preferences`** — returns `{ prefs: UserPreferences }`
  for the resolved owner. Empty object when no row exists. Auth:
  the standard hybrid identity (Clerk Bearer OR `X-Owner-Id`).
- **`PUT /api/preferences`** — body `{ prefs: UserPreferences }`,
  upserts the row for the resolved owner. Returns 204. The blob
  is opaque to the api worker beyond a size cap (4 KB; defends
  against runaway clients). No per-field validation: the client
  is responsible for the shape, and a malformed client just
  reflects malformed prefs back to itself.
