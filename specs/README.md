## Workflow

- A new feature, scope decision, or constraint goes into a spec **before** code.
- Reference specs by filename in PRs and discussions.
- If two specs conflict, that's the bug — fix the specs first, then the code.
- Keep specs terse but unambiguous. Update them when something changes; don't let them drift.
