# Help app

A standalone help centre at `/help`, modelled on the Manager Toolkit help centre but with livediagram's information architecture, content, and brand.

## Why

The editor is friction-free and discoverable, but there's no place that explains features in depth, answers "how do I…", or covers account/privacy/self-hosting questions. A searchable help centre fills that gap and doubles as SEO surface (every article is an indexable static page).

## Shape

A new Next.js app, `apps/help`, deployed as the `livediagram-help` Worker and stitched in by the router under `/help` — the same pattern as `apps/telemetry` (see [spec/08](08-router-app.md), [spec/22](22-telemetry.md)):

- `output: 'export'`, `basePath: '/help'`, `assetPrefix: '/help'`. Static only, no SSR (see [hard constraints](../CLAUDE.md)).
- The router strips `/help` and forwards to the worker, which serves `./out`.
- Content is **MDX** (`@next/mdx`) plus a TypeScript article index (`lib/articles.ts`). Navigation/index pages are TSX.

It behaves **exactly like the Manager Toolkit help centre**: hero + client-side search, a category grid, a "Feature Guides" grid, article pages with an auto-generated table of contents, breadcrumbs, "Was this helpful?" feedback, reading time, related-guide sidebar, and a back-to-top button. The difference is the categories/content (livediagram's) and the **brand**: livediagram is light + sky-blue (`brand-500`, see [spec/01](01-color-scheme.md)), not MT's dark purple, so every surface uses the shared `@livediagram/tailwind-config` brand ramp and slate neutrals to match `apps/marketing` and `apps/telemetry`.

### No paid tier

livediagram is free and MIT-licensed with no plan for a paid tier (see [spec/03](03-open-source-and-business-model.md)). So the help centre has **no "Accounts and Billing" category and no "Pro" callouts**. Instead it carries a **Self-hosting** category, reflecting that anyone can run their own instance.

## Information architecture

`lib/articles.ts` is the single source of truth for categories and articles. Two flat arrays (`categories`, `articles`) plus helpers (`getArticlesByCategory`, `getCategoryGroups`, `getSubArticles`, `searchArticles`). An article's `categorySlug` is its full nested path (e.g. `canvas/the-canvas`); `parentSlug` links a sub-article to its feature landing page.

**Sub-category grouping.** A feature category's landing cards can be split into labelled sub-category sections on its index page via an optional `group` field on each landing (e.g. Palette's `Selection Modes` / `Elements` / `Palette Settings`). `getCategoryGroups` buckets the category's landings by `group` in first-appearance order, and `FeatureCategoryIndex` renders one card grid per group under a heading. Landings without a `group` render in a single ungrouped grid, so other feature categories are unchanged.

Categories fall into two kinds. The **support** categories carry standalone articles; the **feature** categories (`kind: 'feature'`) carry the in-depth feature guides and are grouped under a separate "Feature Guides" heading on the home page and the `/features` index. Each feature category has a card-grid index page at `/help/<slug>/` (shared `FeatureCategoryIndex` component), and within it each feature has its own landing page plus optional sub-articles.

The feature categories group the feature guides by area:

- **Explorer** — the diagram library (explorer/15, teams/32+35): The Explorer overview, Recent, Shared with you, My Work and folders, Team Spaces, Image Gallery, and Saved Themes, one guide per sidebar section.
- **Palette** — the floating palette, in three sub-categories grouped on the index (see "Sub-category grouping" below): **Selection Modes** (one guide per tool-picker mode: Select, Hand, Eraser, Format Painter, Laser, Spotlight, Isometric), **Elements** (one guide per palette tab: Shapes (+ shape markers, style presets 48), Arrows (+ arrow styles, curve/elbow handles, arrow-to-arrow), Tools (+ drawing/shape-recognition, images, data elements 46+51+52+53), Components, Devices, Icons, Technology 41), and **Palette Settings** (one guide per gear-menu setting: Auto-Attach Arrows, Alignment Guides, Minimal Panels, Reset Palette Position).
- **Canvas** — the infinite canvas (09), selecting and grouping (selection/groups), links and link cards (40), annotations (38), themes (29+42+44), templates, text and fonts (28).
- **Tabs** — multiple boards (13+17+30): Tabs, Tab Folders, Linking Across Tabs, Add a Tab to Another Diagram, Importing (27), Exporting, and Cleanup (47), one guide per tab-menu action.
- **Collaboration** — comments, live presence (07: live cursors / selections / per-tab presence), teams (32+35), sharing and embeds (24+33+34), session tools (39).
- **Activity Panel** — the per-diagram change log (12) promoted to its own category: What it is, How it works, Undo, Redo, and Reverting a change, one guide each.
- **Tools** — AI assistance (25), zen mode (26), light/dark UI mode (07), Markdown import (27), layout cleanup (47).
- **Search Panel** — the global search (09): an overview landing plus sub-articles for each thing search does, finding diagrams/folders, teams, tabs and elements, adding palette items to the canvas, and the Create-new-tab action.

Where a feature's name would equal its category slug, the landing slug is distinguished (`the-canvas`, `the-explorer`, `using-tabs`) so a feature slug never equals a category slug (which would break the breadcrumb's parent link).

There is **no Presentation Mode guide**: spec/31 is a draft and the feature is not built, so the article was unpublished rather than ship documentation for a non-existent feature.

## In-article illustrations

Articles were text-heavy, so each section that benefits from a picture carries a
**figure**: an inline SVG mock of the real editor surface it describes (the
palette, a dialog, the tab bar, a flow of shapes, live cursors, ...). They are
SVG, not screenshots, so they stay crisp, theme with the brand ramp, add zero
binary assets to the static export, and never drift from a UI rebrand the way a
captured screenshot would.

The system has three layers, all under `apps/help`:

- **`components/illustrations/primitives.tsx`** — the shared SVG kit (`Scene`,
  `Shape`, `Arrow`, `SelectionBox`, `Cursor`, `Avatar`, `Panel`, `Dialog`,
  `Button`, `Tabs`, `Menu`, `Tile`, `Label`, `TextBar`). Every figure composes
  from these so the house style (white panels, slate borders, sky-blue `brand`
  accents) lands in one place. This is the no-duplication rule applied to art.
- **`components/illustrations/<area>.tsx`** — one file per area (canvas, palette,
  collaboration, ...) exporting named **scene** components (e.g.
  `CanvasOverview`, `ThemePicker`) built from the primitives. Branch hues beyond
  brand use the on-brand accent set (emerald / violet / amber / rose / teal /
  indigo) already used by `featureColours`.
- **`components/Figure.tsx`** — frames any scene in an "editor viewport" card
  with an optional caption. Registered globally in `mdx-components.tsx` (like
  `Tip` / `Note`), so an article only imports the specific scene and writes
  `<Figure caption="…"><Scene/></Figure>`.

Figures are added to the sections that genuinely benefit (a concrete UI surface,
a before/after, a spatial relationship), not to every section; reference-only or
purely conceptual sections stay text. Scenes are reused across articles wherever
the same surface recurs rather than redrawn.

## In-editor entry point

The editor's `TabBar` gains a **Help** link on its right edge, beside the existing GitHub link — a plain `<a href="/help/" target="_blank">` (same convention as the GitHub link, no editor-page wiring). It fires `track('UI', 'Opened', 'Help')` (see [spec/22](22-telemetry.md); reuses existing `UI`/`Opened` enum pair). A "Help" link also lives in the help app's own header/footer.

### Help in global search

The editor's global search panel (spec/09) surfaces matching help articles as a
**Help** group, so "how do I…" is answerable without leaving the canvas. Since
the editor and help centre are separate builds, the searchable catalogue is a
curated view in `apps/live/lib/help-search.ts` (title + keyword synonyms per
article, resolved to a `/help` href via the `help-articles.ts` deep-link map);
keep it in sync with that map. `buildSearchResults` stays catalogue-agnostic
(the surface passes `helpItems`, the same pattern as palette results), matches
title + keywords on a non-empty query only, ranks the group last (navigation and
edit results keep the default Enter), and picking one opens the article in a new
tab. Both the editor and the Explorer pass the catalogue, since help is global.

## Analytics

The help app is a static site outside the editor, so it does not use the editor's first-party telemetry pipeline. It emits nothing by default (no third-party scripts), keeping it self-host-clean. The in-editor Help link is the only telemetry touchpoint, via the existing pipeline.

## Deployment

A `deploy-help` job in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` mirrors `deploy-telemetry` (build artifact → `wrangler deploy`). The router's `deploy-router` job already depends on the static apps; it gains a dependency on `deploy-help`, and `apps/router/wrangler.toml` gains a `HELP` service binding to `livediagram-help`.

## Out of scope (for now)

- Surfacing the full ~140-article catalogue in editor search. The in-editor
  catalogue (`help-search.ts`) is a curated subset of the articles the editor
  deep-links; a shared package exposing the whole registry to both builds can
  come later if broader coverage is wanted.
