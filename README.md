# livediagram

A collaborative diagram editor that works without signing in. Open a link, draw, share. Real-time presence, cursors, comments, per-tab activity log with surgical revert. The canvas never sits behind an auth wall, so the friction to start is "open the link, start drawing."

**Live at [livediagram.app](https://livediagram.app).** MIT-licensed and self-hostable end-to-end.

```
apps/        marketing site + editor + telemetry dashboard + help centre + api + mcp server + router
packages/    shared diagram model, wire-format types, UI primitives, configs
specs/       product source of truth, read these before adding features
scripts/     repo-wide dev tooling (shared Next.js dev launcher)
docs/        practical guides for using, hosting, and contributing
marketing/   off-site copy + media for listings and promotion (see specs/23)
```

## The 30-second tour

- **Marketing** at `/` is the pitch and feature tour.
- **Editor** is the canvas, served at clean routes (`/new`, `/diagram/<id>`, `/explorer/...`; no `/live` prefix). Guests get a per-browser identity and full persistence; signed-in users get the same plus cross-device sync.
- **API** at `/api/*` is a Cloudflare Worker (REST + WebSocket realtime room per diagram, backed by D1).
- **Telemetry** at `/telemetry` is the public anonymous-events dashboard (off in OSS forks by default).
- **Help** at `/help` is the static help centre (guides, feature docs, troubleshooting).
- **Router** stitches the five under one hostname.

The whole stack runs on Cloudflare Workers (Static Assets for the Next.js apps). There's no Node-hosted backend, no SSR, no Next.js API routes.

## The rules that keep the repo honest

- **Specs first**: every product decision lives in [`specs/`](specs/). Write or update the spec before the code. See [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md).
- **Static-only frontends**: Next.js `output: 'export'`. Server logic goes in the api worker, never in Next.js.
- **Reuse over duplication**: shared code lives in [`packages/`](packages/), never copied across apps.
- **No secrets in source**: the repo is public. Env vars, `wrangler secret put`, GitHub Actions secrets only. See [`specs/06`](specs/06-secrets-policy.md).

## License

[MIT](LICENSE). Anyone can self-host. A free hosted version runs alongside at [livediagram.app](https://livediagram.app); there's **no paid tier and no plan to introduce one** ([`specs/03`](specs/03-open-source-and-business-model.md)). The OSS core has one optional SaaS dependency (Clerk for auth) and runs fully without it.
