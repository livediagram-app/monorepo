# Docs

Documentation for livediagram, the open-source real-time diagram editor.

These docs are the practical guide: what the app does, how to run it locally, how to host it on your own Cloudflare account, and how to contribute. For the why-behind-the-what (product decisions, constraints, behaviour contracts), read the [specs](../specs/). Specs are normative; these docs explain.

## Contents

| Doc                                            | Covers                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [What is livediagram?](what-is-livediagram.md) | The product: what it does, who it's for, what's built and what's still ahead.     |
| [Architecture](architecture.md)                | The repo shape: five apps, seven packages, the Cloudflare-only deployment model.  |
| [Local development](local-development.md)      | Clone, install, run all apps locally, scope commands to a single workspace.       |
| [Self-hosting](self-hosting.md)                | Run your own copy on Cloudflare Workers + D1. Optional Clerk auth.                |
| [Contributing](contributing.md)                | How to propose changes: specs-first workflow, code style, tests, PR expectations. |

## How docs relate to specs

- **Docs** (this folder): user-facing + contributor-facing instructions. How to do things.
- **[Specs](../specs/)**: product source of truth. Why the app behaves the way it does, what the contracts are, what's in scope.

If a doc disagrees with a spec, the spec wins (and the doc is the bug). Docs link out to specs when readers should go deeper.
