# Self-hosting

livediagram is designed to be self-hostable end-to-end. The whole stack runs on Cloudflare Workers, so a self-hoster needs a Cloudflare account and not much else.

This guide is the practical path: provision Cloudflare resources, configure secrets, deploy. For the why-behind-the-shape, read [spec/10](../specs/10-deployment.md) (deployment) and [spec/06](../specs/06-secrets-policy.md) (secrets).

## What you'll provision on Cloudflare

| Resource                             | Used by         | Why                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workers paid plan**                | All six workers | Durable Objects (per-diagram realtime room) need the paid plan.                                                                                                                    |
| **D1 database**                      | `apps/api`      | Diagrams, tabs, comments, folders, share links, shared-with index, change log, image metadata, user preferences, teams + membership + team library, custom themes, telemetry rows. |
| **Durable Object namespace**         | `apps/api`      | One stateful room per diagram for realtime presence + ops.                                                                                                                         |
| **R2 bucket** (optional)             | `apps/api`      | Image uploads. The api degrades to `503 images-unavailable` without it.                                                                                                            |
| **Rate Limiter bindings** (optional) | `apps/api`      | Per-owner write throttle + per-IP telemetry throttle.                                                                                                                              |
| **Custom domain**                    | `apps/router`   | The router worker serves your hostname; downstream workers don't need their own domain.                                                                                            |

What you do NOT need:

- Clerk: auth is optional. Without it, every user is a guest (a per-browser id stored in `localStorage`, carried as `X-Owner-Id`). With Clerk configured, the api worker reaches `CLERK_JWKS_URL` to verify Bearer tokens; that's the only outbound SaaS dependency, and only on the auth path.
- Any other SaaS: no Stripe (no paid tier), no Resend (transactional email isn't built yet), no analytics vendor. The telemetry endpoint is first-party only and off by default.
- A separate database host: D1 covers everything.

## One-time Cloudflare setup

1. **Create a Cloudflare account** and sign up for the Workers paid plan ($5/mo at the time of writing).
2. **Create a D1 database**:

   ```sh
   pnpm exec wrangler d1 create livediagram
   ```

   Copy the `database_id` from the output into `apps/api/wrangler.toml` under the `[[d1_databases]]` block (it already has the binding name `DB`; you only need to update the id).

3. **Apply migrations to the new D1**:

   ```sh
   pnpm --filter @livediagram/api db:migrate:remote
   ```

   (this runs `wrangler d1 migrations apply livediagram --remote` — note it takes the database **name**, `livediagram`, not the binding name `DB`).

   This creates every table the worker expects. The same command runs in the deploy workflow on every release, so you only need it once for the first deploy.

4. **Create an R2 bucket** (optional, for images):

   ```sh
   pnpm exec wrangler r2 bucket create livediagram-images
   ```

   The bucket name is bound to `IMAGES` in `apps/api/wrangler.toml`.

5. **Get an API token + account id**:
   - Account id is at the bottom-right of any Cloudflare dashboard page.
   - API token: create one with **Workers Scripts: Edit**, **D1: Edit**, **R2: Edit** (only if using images), **Workers KV: Edit** (for Durable Objects), and **Account → Account Settings: Read** on your account. Save it.

## Required GitHub Actions secrets

If you're deploying via GitHub Actions (the default workflow), set two repo secrets:

- `CF_API_TOKEN`: the token from the step above.
- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`: your Cloudflare account id.

That's it. The deploy workflow uses raw `pnpm exec wrangler deploy` against these credentials.

## Optional Clerk auth

The hosted version uses Clerk for sign-in. To enable on your self-host:

1. Create a Clerk application in the [Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).
2. Copy the publishable key and the JWKS URL.
3. Set them on the two workers / apps:
   - **Live (build-time, browser-side)**: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in your CI build env, or in `apps/live/.env.production`.
   - **API (worker secret)**:

     ```sh
     pnpm --filter @livediagram/api exec wrangler secret put CLERK_JWKS_URL
     ```

     Paste the JWKS URL when prompted.

4. **For Teams (spec/32) — add the email claim to the session token.** Invite auto-connection matches pending invites against the verified `email` claim in the Clerk JWT, which the default session token doesn't carry. In the Clerk dashboard, customise the session token (Sessions → Customize session token) to include:

   ```json
   { "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}" }
   ```

   Without it, teams still work (create / roles / member management), but an invited address only connects when an admin re-invites after the claim is configured; the worker never trusts a client-supplied email.

5. **Recommended when Clerk is on — sign guest ids.** Set a random HMAC secret so the worker mints signed guest ids and `POST /api/migrate` requires a valid signature before moving a guest's data into a Clerk account. Without it, anyone who observed a guest's id (it appears in shared-diagram DTOs / presence) could claim that guest's data at sign-up. Generate and set:

   ```sh
   openssl rand -hex 32 | pnpm --filter @livediagram/api exec wrangler secret put GUEST_ID_HMAC_SECRET
   ```

   Leaving it unset keeps the legacy unsigned migrate, which is fine for a single-user self-host (no one else to claim from). See [spec/04](../specs/04-auth-and-guest-access.md).

   With the secret set, you can also require a valid signature on the guest `X-Owner-Id` REST path (spec/61 §4) — this closes the "observe a guest id, use it as a credential" hole for shared diagrams. It's **off by default** so pre-signing guests aren't locked out; set `GUEST_SIG_ENFORCE_AFTER` to an epoch-ms cutoff once your active guests have rotated to signed ids (the app re-signs on load):

   ```sh
   echo "$(date +%s000)" | pnpm --filter @livediagram/api exec wrangler secret put GUEST_SIG_ENFORCE_AFTER
   ```

6. **API tokens (spec/61) come with Clerk.** They're a signed-in-only feature, so a self-host with Clerk configured gets the Explorer "API tokens" section automatically; a guest-only self-host has no accounts and therefore no tokens (nothing to configure). Each token lasts six months and is stored hashed.

7. **Optional — "Continue with Google" button.** To surface Google OAuth on `/sign-in` and `/get-started`, enable the Google SSO connection in the Clerk dashboard (a production `pk_live_*` instance needs your own Google Cloud OAuth client registered against Clerk's redirect URI, `https://clerk.<domain>/v1/oauth_callback`, shown verbatim in the dashboard), then set the build-time flag on the live app alongside the publishable key:

   ```sh
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_OAUTH_ENABLED=true
   ```

   Like the publishable key it's baked in at build time (CI env or `apps/live/.env.production`). It's gated on Clerk being configured, so it's a no-op in guest-only mode. Unset keeps just the email-code sign-in.

Without the Clerk vars set, the api worker treats every request as a guest (resolves owner from `X-Owner-Id`), and the live frontend's ClerkProvider becomes a pass-through that renders the editor without any auth UI. Self-host without Clerk is a fully-supported path; the canvas works identically (and guest-id signing is moot, since there's no migrate without Clerk accounts).

See [spec/04](../specs/04-auth-and-guest-access.md) for the hybrid auth model.

## Deploy

After the one-time Cloudflare setup:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/livediagram-app/monorepo livediagram
cd livediagram
pnpm install
pnpm build           # static export for marketing + live + telemetry + help
# Then deploy each worker (run from the repo root):
pnpm --filter @livediagram/marketing exec wrangler deploy
pnpm --filter @livediagram/live exec wrangler deploy
pnpm --filter @livediagram/telemetry exec wrangler deploy
pnpm --filter @livediagram/help exec wrangler deploy
pnpm --filter @livediagram/api exec wrangler deploy
pnpm --filter @livediagram/router exec wrangler deploy   # last, depends on the five above
```

Deploy order matters: the router's service bindings reference the five other workers, so it can't deploy until they exist; the optional `mcp` worker deploys after `api` (it binds to it). The GitHub Actions deploy workflow encodes this as job dependencies.

Or just push to `main` and use the bundled GitHub Actions workflows:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint / format / typecheck / test / build on every PR and push.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is **manually triggered** from the Actions tab. It builds once then deploys all six workers in the right order.

See [spec/10](../specs/10-deployment.md) for the deeper deploy mechanics, including how D1 migrations run BEFORE the worker deploy so the new code never briefly runs against the old schema.

## MCP server (optional, needs Clerk)

The `apps/mcp` worker (spec/62) lets people connect an AI tool (Claude, any MCP
client) to drive their diagrams. It's **optional** — don't deploy it and nothing
else references it — and **needs Clerk**, exactly like API tokens and teams: the
OAuth consent page authenticates the user via Clerk and the api's
`/api/oauth/exchange` requires a Clerk identity, so a no-auth self-host can mint
nothing. To run it:

1. **Create a KV namespace** for OAuth state and put the id in `apps/mcp/wrangler.toml`:

   ```sh
   pnpm --filter @livediagram/mcp exec wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV
   ```

2. **Point it at your hosts.** In `apps/mcp/wrangler.toml` set the `[[routes]]`
   pattern to your MCP hostname and `CONSENT_BASE_URL` to your live app's origin.
   Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_ORIGIN` (live build env) to the same MCP origin so the
   consent page posts the minted token only to your trusted host.

3. **Deploy after the api worker** (it reaches api over a service binding). The
   deploy workflow already orders `mcp` after `api`. Tokens minted via the MCP
   are ordinary `lvd_` API tokens — they appear in the Explorer's API tokens
   page and are revocable there.

The MCP carries no model of its own and makes no LLM calls; the connected AI
tool does the thinking. See [spec/62](../specs/62-mcp-server.md).

## Telemetry: off by default for self-hosters

The api worker's telemetry ingest (`/api/events`) is off unless `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true` is set in `apps/api/wrangler.toml`. OSS forks ingest nothing by default. If you DO turn it on, the public `/telemetry` dashboard renders aggregate counts from your own D1; there's no third-party analytics involved. See [spec/22](../specs/22-telemetry.md).

Turning telemetry on end-to-end takes BOTH the server gate above AND a build-time gate on the editor. The api flag is the authoritative gate (ingest + summary refuse to serve without it), but the live editor also reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` at build time and skips emission entirely when it isn't `"true"`. So a fork that only flips the api flag will see "ingest on" but no events flow. To turn it fully on, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true` in your CI build env (or `apps/live/.env.production`) alongside the api flag. The `/telemetry` dashboard has no client-side gate of its own: it just reads `/api/telemetry/summary`, and the api worker returns an empty `enabled: false` payload until you flip `TELEMETRY_ENABLED`. Per-user opt-out via the Settings dialog (spec/20) still overrides the editor emission when off.

## AI assistance: off by default, needs an OpenAI key

The in-editor AI panel (spec/25) is hidden entirely unless the api worker has an OpenAI key. Forks that don't want it provision nothing and get zero AI surface: `GET /api/capabilities` reports `{ aiEnabled: false }`, `POST /api/ai` returns 503, and the editor never renders the toggle or panel.

To turn it on, set the key as a worker secret:

```bash
pnpm --filter @livediagram/api exec wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Optional knobs (all plain `[vars]` in `apps/api/wrangler.toml`, the dashboard, or `.dev.vars`):

- `OPENAI_MODEL`: model name, defaults to `gpt-4o`.
- `AI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: comma-separated `Origin` allow-list for `POST /api/ai` (e.g. `https://your-host,http://localhost:3002`). Unset = no origin check. Matched verbatim, case-sensitive.
- `AI_REQUIRE_CLERK`: set to `"true"` to reject the guest (`X-Owner-Id`) path on `/api/ai` only, requiring a verified Clerk JWT. Unset = guests can use AI (so a Clerk-less fork still works).

The last two are the spend-DoS defence: on a public deployment they stop a third-party site from minting fresh owner ids to drain your OpenAI budget. The hosted livediagram.app sets both; a private or Clerk-less fork can leave them unset. Two further defences live alongside them: the `AI_RATE_LIMITER` binding (declared in `apps/api/wrangler.toml` as a Cloudflare rate-limit binding, 20 requests / 60 s per IP) caps how fast one client can drive the endpoint; absent binding falls through to "allow" so a self-host without the paid Cloudflare feature still works. AI is also per-user opt-in via the Settings dialog even once the key is present.

## Per-owner image gallery caps

The api worker honours two optional `[vars]` that cap how much one owner can keep in the image gallery (spec/19), surfaced as a 403 `{ error: "gallery-full", reason, limit, current }` on `POST /api/images`:

- `IMAGE_MAX_PER_OWNER`: maximum image rows per owner (decimal string).
- `IMAGE_MAX_BYTES_PER_OWNER`: maximum summed `byte_size` per owner (decimal byte count).

Both default to "no limit" when unset, blank, `0`, or non-numeric, which is the OSS self-host default where the operator runs their own R2 budget. The hosted livediagram.app sets them to `100` and `104857600` (100 MB). The worker also honours an early `X-Image-Sha256` dedupe check sent by the live editor: if the header matches an existing row at `(owner, sha256)` the upload short-circuits before the body parse, the cap check, or the R2 write, so re-uploading bytes the user already has costs almost nothing.

## Custom domain

Add a custom-domain route to the router worker (`apps/router/wrangler.toml`) and point your DNS at Cloudflare. The router stitches all paths under one hostname:

- `/` → marketing
- `/diagram/*`, `/explorer/*`, `/new`, `/join`, `/sign-in`, `/get-started`, `/embed`, `/sso-callback` → live editor (clean routes; `/live/*` carries only its `_next` assets)
- `/telemetry` → telemetry dashboard
- `/help` → help centre
- `/api/*` → api worker

The five downstream workers don't need their own domain; the router fans out via service bindings.

## What can break, and how to debug

- **`account not authorized` from wrangler**: the API token is missing a scope. See the token list above; most often it's missing **Account → Account Settings: Read**, which wrangler uses to look up your account.
- **`Durable Object class is not exported`**: the api worker's `wrangler.toml` references `DiagramRoom` as the DO class. It IS exported from `apps/api/src/index.ts`; if you've forked + renamed, keep the export name in step with the binding.
- **Editor loads but every request 403s**: the resolved owner doesn't match the diagram's stored owner. If you migrated from one auth setup to another (added Clerk after running guest-only), the old guest diagrams still belong to the old guest id. The `/api/migrate` endpoint moves rows from a guest id to a Clerk userId after sign-up; see [spec/04](../specs/04-auth-and-guest-access.md).
