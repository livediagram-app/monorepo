#!/usr/bin/env node
// Shared local-dev entry for the Next.js apps (live, help, ...). Run it
// from an app workspace as `node ../../scripts/next-dev.mjs --port <n>`;
// `cwd` is the app directory, so everything below resolves against it.
//
// It exists because bare `next dev` bit us repeatedly, and in more than
// one app:
//
//  1. The port stays bound after an interrupted `next dev`, so the next
//     start fails with EADDRINUSE and someone chases a stray process.
//  2. The `.next` cache desynchronises after a route restructure or a
//     big file churn, leaving the HMR client asking for chunks the
//     bundler no longer emits ("Cannot find module './257.js'") — or,
//     worse, the `app/layout.css` asset the page <link>s to 404s and the
//     page renders unstyled. The dev server happily serves the broken
//     state until someone wipes the cache by hand. The help centre hit
//     this constantly: ~80 MDX files churned by the docs work (and the
//     background auto-committer renaming files mid-session) outpace what
//     `next dev` reconciles.
//  3. A `next build` anywhere in the same checkout (a repo-root
//     `pnpm build`, a pre-commit suite, a turbo task) overwrites the dev
//     server's `_buildManifest.js.tmp.*` mid-flight, and dev then 500s
//     with `ENOENT: ... _buildManifest.js.tmp.*`.
//
// The cure for all three is the same: free the port, point dev at its own
// `.next-dev/` cache dir (so a concurrent build's `.next/` can never race
// it), and wipe that dir on every start so a corrupted cache never
// survives a restart. Each app's `next.config` reads `NEXT_DISTDIR` and
// falls back to `.next/` when unset, so build / CI keep the default.
